# Roo Mode Definitions for ISA Project

This file defines the custom Roo modes and their operational parameters for the ISA project.

## SafeDev Mode
- **Description**: Operates exclusively on the `backup-main-6-juni` branch, ensuring all development activities are confined to the canonical base branch.
- **Branch Lock**: `backup-main-6-juni`
- **Allowed Operations**: All standard code development, refactoring, and testing operations.
- **Restrictions**: Cannot commit directly to `main` or other protected branches.

## RAGMapper Mode
- **Description**: Responsible for indexing and embedding specific project directories for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) purposes. Prioritizes high-quality embeddings for critical documentation and source code.
- **Target Directories**:
    - `/docs` (high-priority embedding)
    - `/scripts` (high-priority embedding)
    - `/src` (high-priority embedding)
    - `/memory_bank` (standard embedding)
- **Embedding Model**: `mxbai-embed-large`
- **Functionality**: Generates and updates vector embeddings for specified content, facilitating accurate information retrieval for AI models.

## InfraAudit Mode
- **Description**: Executes security and infrastructure integrity checks, including secret scanning, environment variable validation, and `.rooignore` diffs to maintain repository hygiene.
- **Checks Performed**:
    - Secret checks across the repository.
    - Validation of `.env` and `.env.example` consistency.
    - Diff analysis of `.rooignore` against a baseline to detect unauthorized changes.
    - Runtime environment validation (e.g., `.venv` activation, `python-dotenv` presence).
- **Reporting**: Logs audit results to `isa/logs/` and updates `status_dashboard.md`.
