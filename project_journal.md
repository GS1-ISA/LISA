### ISA Debugging Report - 2025-06-22 17:31:45

**Task:** Investigate why the multi-agent workflow is getting stuck.

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1.  **Environment Validation:** Confirmed `.venv` is active, `.env` file is present, and `python-dotenv` is installed.
2.  **API Key Check:** Initial check confirmed `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable was set.
3.  **Script Logging:** Added error handling and logging to `isa/agentic_workflows/langchain_integration.py` to capture runtime errors.
4.  **Dependency Installation:** Installed `langchain`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, and `openai` packages.
5.  **Prompt Template Correction:** Modified `prompt_agent1` to correctly include `{tools}` and `{tool_names}` placeholders as required by `create_react_agent`.
6.  **Explicit .env Loading:** Added `load_dotenv()` call to `isa/agentic_workflows/langchain_integration.py` to ensure environment variables are loaded.
7.  **API Key Validation (User Input):** User provided updated `.env` content with a new `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**Current Status:**
Despite all previous fixes and the user updating the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the `langchain_integration.py` script continues to report an `Error code: 401 - Incorrect API key provided`. This strongly suggests the provided API key itself is invalid or has an issue (e.g., revoked, regional restriction, incorrect organization).

**Next Steps:**
I cannot directly validate the OpenAI API key's functionality or access external network information. The user needs to verify the validity of their OpenAI API key directly with OpenAI.

**Status: ⚠️ PENDING USER ACTION (API Key Validation)**
