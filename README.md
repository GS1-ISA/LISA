# ISA Project

## Intelligent System Architecture

This project aims to develop a sophisticated multi-agent AI system capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks. It leverages advanced AI techniques and robust software engineering practices to create a scalable, secure, and observable platform.

## Project Overview

The ISA project is structured into several key components:

*   **Multi-Agent System:** Core AI agents designed to collaborate and execute complex workflows.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Systems for acquiring, storing, and retrieving knowledge to inform agent decisions.
*   **Tool Integration:** Mechanisms for agents to interact with external tools and APIs.
*   **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing to understand agent behavior and system health.
*   **Security:** Robust practices for secret management, authentication, and authorization.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/isa-project.git
    cd isa-project
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # For Node.js/TypeScript components
    npm install

    # For Python components (if applicable)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    This project uses Google Secret Manager for secure secret management. For local development, authenticate with `gcloud`:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```
    Secrets will be fetched programmatically by the application. Refer to `docs/environment_configuration.md` for more details.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # Example: Start the development server
    npm run dev
    ```
