Title: Maintenance Summary â€” Full-Spectrum Health-Check
Date: 2025-09-02

Changed
- Memory system hardened (router/logs/drift/nap-time, privacy delete APIs, adapter flags)
- CI extended (memory coherence gate, nightly/weekly schedules)
- Docs expanded (orchestration, RAG, MCP, runtime, DSPy, guilds; roadmap/TODO updated)
- Coherence audit artifacts generated (graph, orphans, terms, traceability, scorecard)

Risks Mitigated
- Determinism: canonical JSON + snapshot tests; optional orjson path
- CI Stability: constrained pytest discovery; advisory gates; schedules enabled
- Privacy/Audit: deletion events logged with reasons; memory log snapshot artifact

Metrics Improved
- Tests: all app tests green; type-check clean
- Observability: CI uploads memory log snapshot; metrics endpoint confirmed
- Documentation: comprehensive architecture and roadmap aligned to implementation

Remaining Technical Debt
- Enforce memory coherence gate post-stability
- Add mutation testing to PR/nightly and perf budgets on hot paths
- Implement real external adapters (Zep, MemEngine, MCP) behind flags with parity tests
- Add SBOM/Trivy gating and pip-audit availability in local dev
