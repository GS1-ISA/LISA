# Phase 3: Dead-Code & Clutter Removal Analysis

## Summary
This analysis identifies files that can be safely removed to reduce project bloat. All identified files are either build artifacts, temporary files, or macOS metadata that are not part of the core project functionality.

## Large Binaries (>1 MB) Analysis

### Build Caches (Safe to Remove)
| Path | Size | Last Modified | Justification |
|------|------|---------------|---------------|
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/client-production/index.pack | 2.7M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js build cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/client-production/0.pack | 31M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js build cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/client-development/2.pack.gz | 3.9M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js development cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/client-development/1.pack.gz | 9.5M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js development cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/2.pack.gz | 4.4M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js server cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/server-development/1.pack.gz | 7.2M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js server cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/client-development-fallback/0.pack.gz | 12M | Sep 16 18:27 | Next.js fallback cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/server-production/index.pack | 2.1M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js production cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/cache/webpack/server-production/0.pack | 33M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js production cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/server/vendor-chunks/@tanstack.js | 2.3M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js vendor chunk cache, regenerates on build |
| ./frontend/.next/server/vendor-chunks/next.js | 3.0M | Sep 16 18:26 | Next.js vendor chunk cache, regenerates on build |

### macOS Metadata Files (Safe to Remove)
| Path | Size | Last Modified | Justification |
|------|------|---------------|---------------|
| ./ISA_synthesized/__MACOSX/tests/unit/._test_retrieval.py | ~4K | N/A | macOS resource fork metadata, not needed |
| Various __MACOSX files in subdirectories | Various | Various | macOS system files, excluded in .gitignore |

### Temporary Files (Safe to Remove)
| Path | Size | Last Modified | Justification |
|------|------|---------------|---------------|
| temp_unzip/ | Various | Various | Temporary extraction directory, not part of project |

## Files NOT to Remove

### Referenced Research Data
- `gs1_research/` directory: Referenced in `src/config/gs1_config.py` and multiple source files
- Large PDFs in `gs1_research/`: Research documentation referenced in code
- Large JSON files in `gs1_research/`: Configuration and data files used by the application

### Generated Files
- `meta_inventory.md`: Auto-generated by `scripts/meta_audit.py`, referenced in CI and docs
- `meta_risk_xray.md`: Auto-generated, part of audit process

### Dependencies
- `.venv/` files: Python virtual environment, required for development
- `node_modules/` files: JavaScript dependencies, managed by package managers
- `.git/` objects: Git repository data, essential for version control

### Integration Files
- `context7-master/`: Referenced in `src/docs_provider/context7.py` and configuration files

## Total Potential Cleanup
- Build caches: ~105 MB
- macOS metadata: ~10 MB
- Temporary files: Variable

## Safety Notes
- All identified files are either build artifacts or system metadata
- No source code, configuration, or data files are included
- Files can be safely regenerated or are not needed for project functionality
- Removal will not affect application functionality
