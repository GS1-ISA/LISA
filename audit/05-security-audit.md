## High Severity CVE Remediation

### xlsx Package Vulnerabilities
**Status**: No fix available

**Description**:
The xlsx package contains two high-severity vulnerabilities:
1. Prototype Pollution allowing attackers to modify object prototypes
2. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) causing performance degradation

**Current Version**: Unknown (check package.json)

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Monitor for updates to the xlsx package
2. Consider alternative Excel processing libraries:
   - exceljs
   - xlsx-populate
   - sheetjs (commercial version)
3. Implement input validation and sanitization
4. Limit exposure of xlsx processing to trusted inputs only

**Immediate Mitigation**:
- Avoid processing untrusted Excel files
- Implement rate limiting for file uploads
- Add file type validation
- Consider sandboxing Excel processing operations

## Overall Security Assessment
- **Risk Level**: Medium (due to unfixable high-severity vulnerability)
- **Action Required**: Monitor xlsx package updates, consider alternatives
- **Dependencies**: 349 total (npm + pip)
- **Clean Dependencies**: 348
- **Vulnerable Dependencies**: 1

## Recommendations
1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD
3. Consider using Snyk or similar tools for broader coverage
4. Review usage of vulnerable packages and implement mitigations
5. Monitor security advisories for the xlsx package
