# Governance Model

## Current Status
Simulated DAO with agent-based voting:
- Proposal trigger (Roo)
- Critique + score (Gemini)
- Execution loop (LangGraph)

## DAO Charter Highlights
- Vote weighting by test accuracy
- Budget and compute allocation rights
- Fallback to human override if confidence < 0.7

## Planned Enhancements
- Persistent policy audit logs
- External vote API with HMAC signature
