# ISA Phase 4 – Self-Improving Agent Behavior

This repository documents the simulation, evaluation, and development of Phase 4 of the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project: **Self-Improving Agent Behavior**. It includes a LangGraph-compatible agent framework, Chain-of-Thought prompt evolution, governance mechanisms, and a growing memory of improvements.

---

## 🔍 Overview

ISA is a Firebase- and Genkit-based intelligent assistant for GS1 standard governance. In Phase 4, the focus is on building reflexive AI behavior through autonomous prompt refinement, memory integration, red-teaming, and LangGraph orchestration.
