# Phase 5: Agent Ecosystem & Marketplace

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
Prepare ISA for modular, community-driven extensibility by enabling a plugin architecture, agent discovery, and sandboxed execution. 

## ðŸ”„ Continuity Warning
This phase must accommodate architectural drift from Phases 2â€“4. Reassess assumptions about agent compatibility, interfaces, and trust boundaries.

## ðŸ§  Design Objectives
- Agents as first-class citizens (with metadata, lifecycle, scoring)
- Distributed Plugin Registry (self-hosted or federated)
- Reputation-based selection mechanisms
- Fine-grained permissioning and isolation of agent execution
- Native support for third-party contributors

## ðŸ§ª Seed Strategies (To be matured)
- ðŸŒ± Define agent manifest standard (`agent.json`)
- ðŸŒ± Prototype plugin loader with LangGraph + Genkit
- ðŸŒ± Define scoring models using past performance + feedback signals
- ðŸŒ± Store plugins as GitHub gists with manifest verification

## ðŸ§© Flexible Development Hooks
This document auto-expands based on:
- Agent contributions detected in `plugins/`
- Plugin manifest submissions
- Self-evaluations generated by runtime sandbox monitors
- Voting events recorded during governance (Phase 3)

## ðŸ“‚ Expansion Fields (to be populated):
- [ ] Agent metadata schema
- [ ] Plugin submission checklist
- [ ] Reputation system design
- [ ] Sandbox validation hooks
- [ ] Sample community plugin definitions
