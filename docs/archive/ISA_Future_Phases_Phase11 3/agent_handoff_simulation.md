# Phase 11 – Simulated Agent Handoff

## Scenario
Two GS1 regional nodes (Node_A: EU, Node_B: LATAM) propose a conflicting update to the "Logistics Unit ID" standard.

## Handoff Simulation
- Node_A submits version 2.1 with stricter digital seal compliance
- Node_B proposes 2.1-alt focused on RFID performance in local supply chains

## ISA Resolution Strategy
- Aggregated both proposals using version arbitration agent
- Triggered CoT merge logic with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Result: Created a modular standard (2.1-composite) with dual implementation tracks
- Logged all rationale and version deltas in `VERSION.yaml` with agent signatures

## Outcome
✅ Federated version consensus reached  
✅ Registered into governance ledger  
✅ Deployed for regional testing and further review
