# Phase 14 â€“ Global AI Standards Alliance (GAISA)

## Vision
Unite LLM-driven standards assistants across organizations into a federation that shares schema updates, policy evolutions, and AI-generated contributions to standardization.

## Components
- GAISA Protocol: Defines API, trust model, identity
- Inter-ISA Contracts: Enables co-drafting, voting, and publication workflows
- Federated Knowledge Graph: Real-time KG replication and synchronization
- Governance Ledger: Immutable co-authorship and traceability log

## Strategic Benefits
- Prevents fragmentation of autonomous standards agents
- Enables cross-domain generalization of compliance frameworks
- Global standard change propagation within seconds

## Seed Activities
- Draft GAISA protocol YAML
- Simulate 3-org co-authoring of standard clause
- Trigger consensus agent voting on disputed schema fields
