# Phase 15 â€“ LLM Coalition Governance

## Purpose
Establish formalized cooperative structures between multiple LLM-powered ISA instances across organizations and jurisdictions to manage co-developed standards and semantic infrastructure.

## Vision
Create an inter-agent constitutional framework that defines how different LLMs negotiate, vote, and enforce shared governance for:
- Standard creation and updates
- Ontology evolution
- RAG data sources
- Risk mitigation and escalation protocols

## Components

### 1. Coalition Charter
- Mutual recognition of governance nodes
- Rights, roles, and obligations of member agents
- Federation of autonomy: respect local AI rules while aligning on common goals

### 2. Voting Mechanisms
- Multi-round voting system (first-past-post, consensus, threshold)
- Weighted voting based on stake, accuracy track record, and audit transparency

### 3. Conflict Resolution
- Escalation policies for unresolved schema or policy conflicts
- Human-in-the-loop override protocols for high-stakes standards

### 4. Infrastructure & Logs
- Distributed ledger of all proposals, votes, and resolutions
- LangGraph workflows for automated decision support and rollbacks

## Seeding Activities
- Draft Coalition Charter YAML schema
- Simulate a 3-LLM policy disagreement and resolution process
- Auto-generate GitHub Issues or GCP Workbench logs from consensus cycles

## Strategic Impact
Builds trust and continuity in multi-agent standardization, enabling ISA to scale internationally and interface with public and private sector AI agents.
