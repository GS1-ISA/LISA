# Phase 12 – Standards Market Simulation & Predictive Governance

## Concept Overview
Phase 12 introduces an experimental simulation framework in which GS1 standards evolve inside a controlled economic and regulatory sandbox. This phase enables predictive adaptation and resilience testing by simulating real-world adoption dynamics, market frictions, and policy changes.

## Core Innovations
- Agent-based market simulation of stakeholders adopting or rejecting standards
- Simulated enforcement scenarios, economic incentives, and black swan events
- Feedback loop into earlier phases to validate resilience of proposed standards
- Integration of behavioral and economic models into governance AI agents

## Potential Use Cases
- Predict which GS1 standards are at risk of fragmentation or non-compliance
- Test impact of legislation (e.g. CSRD, PPWR) on global identifier adoption
- Run adoption heatmaps and adoption-pressure indexes for standardization leads

## Next Steps
- Define simulation parameters and actor models
- Prepare Phase 12 planning prompts and delegation logic
- Identify input data streams from Phase 5–11 outputs for seeding the simulation
