# Agent Design â€“ Schema Diff + Translator Tools

## Agents

### SchemaDiffAnalyzer
- Compares two schemas and highlights:
  - Structural deltas
  - Semantic mismatches
  - Optional/required field discrepancies

### ConflictResolver
- Suggests harmonized schema structure or mapping transformation rules
- Uses prior mappings and semantic context

### TranslatorBuilder
- Generates translation middleware between schemas
- Supports JSON, XML, RDF, and OpenAPI specs

### AuditLogger
- Records all translation and conflict resolution events
- Generates versioned harmonization summaries and rollback options

## Technologies
- Uses LangChain for flow logic
- Uses TypeDB and Firestore for schema metadata storage
- Outputs: harmonized schema, mapping config, evaluation report
