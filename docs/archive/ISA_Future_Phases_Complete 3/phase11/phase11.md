# Phase 11 â€“ Distributed Standards Evolution

## Objective
Coordinate decentralized stakeholders (across regions, verticals, or organizations) to co-evolve GS1 standards with real-time context, multi-agent alignment, and dynamically validated use cases.

## Key Goals
- Enable federated participation in standards definition and validation
- Automate version negotiation and standard deprecation logic
- Leverage cross-node pattern recognition for early anomaly detection

## Systems Involved
- Federated LLM nodes
- Interledger-style governance chains
- Standards versioning registry (powered by `VERSION.yaml`)

## Milestones
1. Map stakeholder clusters and sync profiles
2. Define standard lifecycle hooks and signals
3. Launch dynamic co-authoring test with LLM + HITL loop
4. Simulate regional divergence and convergence scenario
5. Finalize version arbitration mechanism
