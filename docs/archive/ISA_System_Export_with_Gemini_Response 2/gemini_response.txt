Based on the trigger event—a change to a single Genkit flow's name from `myFlow` to `tellJoke`—I have selected the appropriate regeneration strategy.

Strategy Selection: Concise Strategy (`self_healing_doc_prompt_concise.md`)

Justification:
The detected change is a minor, localized update affecting a single function's endpoint name. This task does not involve interdependent systems, schema redesigns, or systemic architectural drift. Therefore, the Concise Strategy is the optimal choice. It allows for a rapid and targeted rewrite of the specific documentation section without the overhead of a comprehensive architectural analysis, ensuring efficiency and resourcefulness.

Regenerated Documentation
`tellJoke` Flow
This flow is a simple demonstration that takes a text input and returns the same text as output. It is exposed as a callable function named `tellJoke` using the `onCallGenkit` wrapper, which makes it accessible as an HTTP endpoint.

Invocation:
To call this flow, you can use a POST request to its endpoint. When testing locally with the Firebase emulator suite, the request would look like this:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/<your-project-id>/<your-region>/tellJoke -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data":{"text":"hi"}}'

The expected response would be:
{
  "result": "hi"
}

You can test and debug this flow interactively using the Genkit Developer UI, which automatically recognizes defined flows from your codebase.

Recommendations for Future Drift Prevention
To further enhance the autonomous capabilities of this documentation system, I recommend the following improvement:

Strengthen the Semantic Contract: The `VERSION.yaml` file for each documentation module should be enhanced to include a `source_code_links` field. This field would explicitly map documentation sections to the specific functions or flows they describe in the source code (e.g., `tellJoke_flow: 'src/index.ts#myFlow'`). This creates a direct, machine-readable link between documentation and code. During the "Monitor" phase of the MAPE-K loop, the CI/CD pipeline can then parse the git diff and use this mapping to automatically and precisely identify which documentation sections are affected by a change, triggering the self-healing workflow with greater accuracy.
