## Top 5 Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. High Memory Usage (Critical)
**Impact:** Severe  
**Current Level:** 80-84% across all components  
**Description:** All components consistently use 80%+ of available memory, indicating memory inefficiency and potential leaks.  
**Evidence:** API server: 84.1%, Agents: 79.7%, Vector Store: 81.4%  
**Recommended Action:** Implement memory profiling and optimize data structures, caching strategies, and garbage collection.

### 2. Vector Store CPU Utilization (High)
**Impact:** High  
**Current Level:** 67.9% CPU usage  
**Description:** Vector store operations consume significantly more CPU than other components.  
**Evidence:** 67.9% vs 41.4% (API) and 39.5% (Agents)  
**Recommended Action:** Optimize vector operations, implement CPU-efficient algorithms, and consider GPU acceleration for vector computations.

### 3. API Server Response Time (High)
**Impact:** High  
**Current Level:** 8.03 seconds for basic health checks  
**Description:** API server takes 4x longer than other components for simple operations.  
**Evidence:** 8.03s vs 2.01s for agents and vector store  
**Recommended Action:** Profile API endpoints, optimize middleware, and implement response caching.

### 4. Test Suite Reliability (Medium)
**Impact:** Medium  
**Current Level:** Multiple test failures  
**Description:** Many tests fail due to missing dependencies and configuration issues.  
**Evidence:** API tests: 11 failed, Agents: 9 failed, Vector Store: 29 errors  
**Recommended Action:** Fix dependency management, update test configurations, and ensure consistent test environment.

### 5. Import and Dependency Issues (Medium)
**Impact:** Medium  
**Current Level:** Multiple AttributeError exceptions  
**Description:** Missing modules and incorrect imports cause runtime failures.  
**Evidence:** chromadb, Pinecone, and other vector store modules not found  
**Recommended Action:** Audit and fix dependency declarations, implement proper error handling for missing optional dependencies.
