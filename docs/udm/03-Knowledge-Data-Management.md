# Section 03: Knowledge Domains & Data Management

This section defines all data sources, schemas, storage mechanisms, data lifecycle, and knowledge representation strategies (including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)) within the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project. It outlines how Roo manages and leverages information.

## 3.1. Data Sources

This subsection lists and describes all external and internal data sources that feed into ISA's knowledge base.

### 3.1.1. Source: [SourceName] (e.g., GS1 General Specifications PDF)

-   **ID:** `DS-XXX`
-   **Type:** (e.g., PDF Document, External API, Database, Web Page)
-   **Location/Access:** (URL, file path, API endpoint, authentication requirements)
-   **UpdateFrequency:** (e.g., "Monthly", "On-demand", "Continuous")
-   **IngestionRooMode:** (e.g., "ROO-MODE-RESEARCH/DataIngestion")
-   **ProcessingPipeline:** (Steps to parse, chunk, embed, index)

## 3.2. Data Schemas & Models

This subsection defines the data models and schemas used throughout ISA, ensuring data consistency and type safety.

### 3.2.1. Schema: [SchemaName] (e.g., DocumentChunk)

-   **ID:** `SCHEMA-XXX`
-   **Purpose:** ...
-   **Format:** (e.g., JSON Schema, Zod Schema, GraphQL Schema)
-   **Definition:**
    ```json
    // Embedded JSON Schema or link to /schemas/document_chunk_schema.json
    {
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "DocumentChunk",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" },
        "content": { "type": "string" },
        "source_ref": { "type": "string" },
        "embedding_vector": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "number" } }
      }
    }
    ```

## 3.3. Vector Store Management

This subsection details the vector databases used for storing and retrieving embeddings for RAG purposes.

-   **Provider:** (e.g., Vertex AI Vector Search, AlloyDB AI pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate, Upstash Vector)
-   **EmbeddingModel:** (e.g., `text-embedding-004`, `text-embedding-ada-002`)
-   **IndexingStrategy:** (e.g., "Batch updates", "Real-time indexing")
-   **UpdateProcess:** (How embeddings are generated and updated)

## 3.4. Knowledge Graph (KG)

This subsection defines the structure and management of the ISA Knowledge Graph, which stores interconnected facts and relationships.

-   **OntologyDefinition:** (Link to ontology file or embedded description, e.g., OWL, SHACL)
-   **KeyEntityTypes:** (e.g., "GS1_Standard", "Product", "Attribute", "Rule")
-   **KeyRelationshipTypes:** (e.g., "defines", "appliesTo", "hasAttribute", "conflictsWith")
-   **PopulationStrategy:** (How the KG is built and maintained, e.g., "Automated extraction from UDM", "Manual curation", "LLM-driven fact extraction")

## 3.5. Memory Bank

The Memory Bank is a structured, persistent storage system for Roo's operational state, historical events, and synthesized knowledge. It is crucial for Roo's long-term learning and context management.

-   **Location:** `/memory_bank/` (within the project workspace)
-   **Components:**
    *   `blueprint_state.json`: Current execution position, last known state, flags.
    *   `history/events.json`: Log of significant operational events and task outcomes.
    *   `knowledge_base/`: Synthesized research findings, architectural decisions, learned patterns.
-   **Access:** Managed by Roo's core logic and specific modes.

## 3.6. Context7 (Advanced Long-Term Context)

-   **Concept:** "Context7" represents an advanced mechanism for managing Roo's long-term, semantic context, allowing for highly efficient retrieval of relevant information across the entire system's knowledge base (codebase, UDM, logs, research). It aims to provide Roo with a deeper, more persistent understanding beyond immediate conversational context.
-   **Mechanism (To be defined by Roo via `TASK-P0-M0.1-T017`):** This could involve:
    *   Leveraging a Vector Database (e.g., Vertex AI Vector Search) for semantic search over all textual artifacts.
    *   Integrating with a dedicated Context7 service (e.g., `context7.com` by Upstash) for library documentation and code examples.
    *   Advanced indexing and retrieval strategies across all data sources.
    *   A sophisticated prompt-chaining or Tree-of-Thought mechanism that allows Roo to dynamically pull in relevant context.
-   **Integration:** `Context7DocumentationTool` (defined in UDM Section 02.5) is an initial step towards integrating external context services.
