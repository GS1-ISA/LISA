# Section 05: Development Roadmap & Lifecycle Management

This section defines the high-level project roadmap, phases, milestones, tasks, dependencies, and the overall development lifecycle process for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA). It serves as the primary input for Roo's Blueprint Mode to plan and orchestrate development.

## 6.1. Overall Strategic Goals

(Derived from Core Mandate defined in UDM Section `01-Core-Mandate.md` and the Master "Autonomous Supreme Architect" Prompt)

*   **Goal 1 (System Mastery):** Achieve and maintain absolute system mastery of the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA), ensuring all components are optimally designed, implemented, and integrated.
*   **Goal 2 (Documentation Fidelity):** Create and sustain immaculate, comprehensive, and always up-to-date documentation for ISA within this UDM.
*   **Goal 3 (Runtime Resilience):** Engineer invincible runtime resilience for ISA, with proactive error handling, self-healing capabilities, and robust performance.
*   **Goal 4 (Strategic Foresight & Evolution):** Enable ISA to be a perpetually self-optimizing and evolving intelligence that can proactively adapt to new GS1 standards, technological advancements, and emerging best practices.
*   **Goal 5 (UDM Supremacy):** Ensure this UDM is the single, inviolable source of truth, and that all ISA development and Roo operations are perfectly aligned with it.

## 6.2. Phase: 0 - Systemic Actualization

-   **ID:** `PHASE-0`
-   **Objective:** To initialize Roo's autonomous operational capabilities, perform a comprehensive audit of the existing ISA project (if any pre-existing state is provided) against this UDM's foundational structure, populate critical UDM sections with baseline information, and establish Roo's core governance loop. This phase ensures Roo is fully aware, grounded in the UDM, and ready to commence systematic development and self-improvement as defined in subsequent phases.
-   **EntryCriteria:**
    -   Roo activated with Master Prompt v2.0_ARCHITECT_ULTIME (or later).
    -   Initial UDM structure (Sections 00-11 as designed) is in place at `/docs/udm/` (even if some sections are templates awaiting population).
    -   Roo has necessary capabilities for file system interaction, UDM parsing, and logging.
-   **ExitCriteria/Deliverables:**
    -   UDM `00-UDM-Meta.md` is updated with Roo's first operational timestamp.
    -   UDM Sections `01`, `02`, `02.5`, `03`, `04`, `06`, `07`, `08`, `09`, `10`, `11` are populated with initial baseline information derived from audit or default templates.
    -   `blueprint_state.json` and `roo_queue.json` are initialized and functional.
    -   `/logs/blueprint-mode.log` and `/logs/mode-handovers.md` are actively being used.
    -   A defined "Milestone 0.1: Initial Baseline & UDM Population" is `VALIDATED`.
    -   Roo has formulated and logged its initial 5-cycle strategic roadmap within this UDM section (as per its Master Prompt's Initial Operational Directive).
-   **EstimatedDuration:** (To be determined by Roo based on initial audit complexity)

### 6.2.1. Milestone: M0.1 - Initial Baseline & UDM Population

#### 6.2.1.33. Task: Refine UDM for Genkit-Native Dual-LLM Architecture (Claude on Vertex AI)

-   **ID:** `TASK-P0-M0.1-T033`
-   **ParentMilestone:** `MILESTONE-P0-M0.1`
-   **Description:** Based on the understanding that Genkit's `@genkit-ai/vertexai` plugin can likely directly invoke Claude partner models on Vertex AI (including tool use), revise relevant UDM sections to reflect this simplified dual-LLM architecture. This removes the need for a separate "Inter-Model Orchestration Service/Bridge" as previously conceptualized in T016. `ClaudeBrowserMode` will be a standard Genkit flow configured to use Claude Sonnet 3.5 on Vertex AI, callable by other Genkit flows. The 8 browser sub-action tools will be defined as Genkit tools whose backing functions perform the browser automation.
-   **AssignedRooMode:** `ROO-MODE-UPDATE-UDM-TECHNICAL`
-   **Inputs:**
    -   `contextual_inputs`:
        -   Relevant sections of the "Genkit Framework: Capabilities Assessment for Roo Development" report.
        -   Anthropic documentation on "Claude on Vertex AI".
        -   UDM Sections to be updated: `02-System-Architecture.md`, `02.5 Core System Tools & Capabilities`, `04-Roo-Modes.md`, `06-Operational-Config.md`.

-   **ExpectedOutputs:**
    -   **UDM `02-System-Architecture.md` updated:** Concept of "Inter-Model Orchestration Service/Bridge" removed, replaced by Genkit standard flow invocation. Architectural diagrams reflect `ClaudeBrowserMode` as a Genkit flow. Infrastructure notes emphasize Vertex AI setup for both Gemini and Claude.
    -   **UDM `02.5 Core System Tools & Capabilities` updated:** The 8 Browser Sub-Action Tools are formally defined as Genkit tools with Zod schemas. Implementation notes specify Puppeteer/Playwright.
    -   **UDM `04-Roo-Modes.md` (`ClaudeBrowserMode` - RM-CB01) updated:** `Purpose` states it's a Genkit flow. `AI_Model_Dependency` clearly states "Claude Sonnet 3.5 via Vertex AI". `KeyToolsAndCapabilities` lists the 8 Genkit browser sub-action tools.
    -   **UDM `06-Operational-Config.md` updated:** "Anthropic Claude Model Configuration" retitled "Claude on Vertex AI Configuration". Details include GCP project ID, region, specific Vertex AI Claude model ID, `anthropic_version` parameter, IAM permissions.
    -   Task `TASK-P0-M0.1-T016` is officially marked as "Superseded by TASK-P0-M0.1-T033".
    -   Log of all specific changes made to UDM files.
