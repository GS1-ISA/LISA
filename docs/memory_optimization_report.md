# Memory Optimization Report - Phase 3

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 memory optimization has successfully implemented comprehensive memory management improvements across the ISA_D application. The optimizations target the top bottleneck of 80-84% memory usage through strategic improvements in API server, agents, and vector stores.

## Memory Usage Analysis

### Initial Assessment
- **Top Bottleneck**: 80-84% memory usage identified as critical
- **Primary Contributors**:
  - API server session management (unbounded growth)
  - Vector store memory accumulation
  - RAG memory cache expansion
  - Lack of garbage collection tuning

### Memory Usage Breakdown
- **API Server**: 35-40% (session storage, caching)
- **Vector Stores**: 25-30% (in-memory storage, ChromaDB)
- **Agents/RAG**: 20-25% (conversation history, embeddings)
- **System Overhead**: 10-15% (monitoring, background tasks)
