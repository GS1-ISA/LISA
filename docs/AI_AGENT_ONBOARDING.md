# AI Agent Onboarding Guide

This document serves as the central onboarding guide for any AI agent (e.g., Gemini Code Assist, ChatGPT, etc.) working on the ISA_D project. Its purpose is to ensure consistent understanding, behavior, and efficient collaboration across all automated entities.

## 1. Foundational Principles and Policies

All AI agents *must* internalize and strictly adhere to the core principles and policies outlined in:

*   **{doc}`agents/AGENTS`**: This is the foundational set of rules defining agent roles (Planner, Builder, Verifier, Critic), safety mechanisms, and general operational guidelines. It is the single source of truth for agent behavior.

## 2. Project Context and Strategic Goals

To ensure alignment with project objectives, review the following documents:

*   **{doc}`ROADMAP`**: Outlines the strategic goals and long-term vision of the project.
*   **{doc}`AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE`**: Provides an overview of the agentic system's architecture, including how agents interact and manage state.
*   **{doc}`QUALITY_GATES`**: Defines the criteria for success and quality standards for all deliverables.
*   **{doc}`TODO`**: Contains the current tactical work items and tasks assigned to agents.

## 3. Documentation Flow and Navigation

To effectively navigate the project's knowledge base and ensure awareness of relevant content:

*   **Explicit Cross-Referencing:** Always follow and utilize explicit cross-references within documentation (e.g., "For details on X, see `docs/path/to/X.md`").
*   **Automated Reference Validation:** Be aware that `scripts/docs_ref_lint.py` is used to ensure the validity of all documentation references.
*   **Coherence Graph for Contextual Understanding:** The `coherence_graph.json` (generated by `scripts/coherence_audit.py`) provides a machine-readable map of file relationships. Agents should leverage this graph to understand dependencies and contextual information relevant to their current task.

## 4. Preventing Double Work and Managing Context

Due to the inherent limitations of LLM context windows, the project employs specific strategies to prevent redundant effort and maintain continuity:

*   **Repository Indexing and Queryable Knowledge:**
    *   The project maintains a comprehensive index of its codebase. Before undertaking any task, agents *must* query this index to retrieve relevant information about existing files, functions, and past work.
    *   Utilize `scripts/query_index.py` to access the knowledge stored in `storage/index.json` and `tmp_index.json`. This is the primary mechanism for overcoming context window limitations.
*   **Centralized Task Management:**
    *   Consult `docs/TODO.md` to identify new tasks and understand their current status.
    *   Upon task completion, update `docs/TODO.md` to reflect the new status (e.g., marking as done).
*   **Outcome Logging and Summarization:**
    *   Record detailed summaries of completed work in `agent/outcomes/` and contribute to `MAINTENANCE_LOG.md`.
    *   Leverage `scripts/prepare_pr_notes.py` to generate concise summaries of contributions for historical record and human review.
*   **Robust Verification and Self-Correction:**
    *   Adhere to the "Verifier" and "Critic" roles defined in `AGENTS.md`. Always verify proposed changes against existing code and documentation to avoid re-implementing existing functionality.
    *   Utilize project tests (`make test`) and linting (`make lint`) to ensure consistency and prevent regressions.
*   **Agent State Management:**
    *   The `docs/AGENTIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` details how agents manage and persist their internal state regarding task progress and completion. Agents should adhere to these guidelines to ensure continuity across sessions.

## 5. Project Tooling

*   **`Makefile`**: All interactions with project tooling (e.g., running tests, linting, building) should be performed via `Makefile` targets to ensure consistency.
