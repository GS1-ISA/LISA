# ISA Vision & Outcomes — Intelligent Standards Architect (ISA)
Last updated: 2025-09-10

## Vision (Purpose)
Build an Intelligent Standards Architect for GS1: an AI‑augmented expert system that anticipates regulatory and market change, codifies knowledge into standards‑native data and ontologies, and executes via agents and validated data paths (e.g., GDSN) — cutting time‑to‑answer by 50%, keeping PR reverts < 1%, and operating deterministically within strict performance and cost budgets.

## Strategic Outcomes
- Foresight: Predictive signal on standards and ESG/compliance changes with decision‑ready briefs.
- Mapping: At‑scale translation from regulations → GS1 attributes (GDSN/EPCIS), with provenance.
- Expert Execution: “GDSN Agent” that guides/validates submissions and standards work.
- Sector Adoption: Concrete pilots (e.g., circular textiles) with measurable wins and KPIs.

## Pillars (How)
- Ontology & KG: GS1 ontology + research KG for concept alignment and traceability.
- Agentic Loops: Plan→Research→Synthesize with memory and determinism gates.
- Evidence‑First CI: Determinism, coverage/mutation, perf, cost, and memory coherence gates.
- FinOps & Sustainability: Bounded cost, CI minutes, and power use with telemetry.

## KPIs (End‑to‑End)
- Time‑to‑answer / time‑to‑standards‑revision: ↓ ≥ 50%.
- Mapping accuracy & coverage: gap‑closure rate; FP/FN profile on ESG→GDSN.
- Prediction hit‑rate: material standards changes detected ahead of time (rolling window).
- GDSN quality: validation defects and rework ↓; acceptance time ↓.
- CI gates: determinism = 100% cross‑OS; perf p95 < 400 ms; cost within budget.

## Pilots & Focus Areas
- Circular Textiles: apply GS1 standards for circularity and ESG reporting.
- Retail ESG: EU ESG compliance mapping to GDSN attributes with retailer datasets.

## Non‑Goals (Guardrails)
- Not a generic chatbot; ISA remains standards‑native and deterministic.
- No legally binding advice; always cite primary sources; keep provenance.
- No irreversible/prod changes without explicit human waiver.
