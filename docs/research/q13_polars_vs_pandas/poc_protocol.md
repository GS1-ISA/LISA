Title: Micro‑POC Protocol — Q13 Polars vs pandas

Question/Hypothesis: Polars (or hybrid) reduces runtime and memory for heavy joins/aggregations by ≥30%.
Success Metrics: ≥30% speedup; reduced peak RSS; acceptable rewrite cost
Dataset & Splits: synthetic large; real anonymized sample if available
Environment: pinned; record resources
Procedure: port target transform; benchmark speed/memory; code diff size
Safety/Legal: data anonymization
Results: (TBD)
Replication Notes: (TBD)
Decision: (TBD)
Follow‑ups: (TBD)
