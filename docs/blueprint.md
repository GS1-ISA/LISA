# ISA Project Blueprint & Architectural Log

This document serves as a living blueprint and log of key architectural decisions, changes, and their rationale for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project. It complements the main "Strategic Roadmap and Architectural Direction for ISA" document.

## Phase 1: Foundational Strengthening & Core Capability Enhancement

### 1.A.1: Immediate Firebase Actions & Adjustments

#### Optimize Cloud Functions Configuration (apphosting.yaml)

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Simulated Date)

**Change:** Updated `apphosting.yaml` to enhance the scalability and efficiency of the Firebase App Hosting backend, which runs our Genkit flows (effectively our Cloud Functions).

**Previous Configuration:**
```yaml
runConfig:
  maxInstances: 1
```

**New Configuration:**
```yaml
runConfig:
  minInstances: 0
  maxInstances: 10
  concurrency: 80
  memoryMiB: 512
  timeoutSeconds: 60
```

**Rationale:**
- **Strategic Alignment:** This change directly addresses the critical scalability bottleneck identified in Phase 1.A.1 of the "Strategic Roadmap and Architectural Direction for ISA." The previous `maxInstances: 1` setting severely limited the system's ability to handle concurrent requests.
- **`maxInstances: 10`**: Provides a significant improvement in concurrent request handling capacity. This is an initial setting and should be refined based on future load testing and performance monitoring. The strategic document suggests 10-20 as a starting range.
- **`minInstances: 0`**: Allows the backend to scale down to zero instances during periods of no traffic. This optimizes costs by avoiding charges for idle instances, aligning with the serverless pay-per-use model.
- **`concurrency: 80`**: Default value, indicating the number of concurrent requests an instance can handle. This may need tuning based on the typical workload of ISA's Genkit flows.
- **`memoryMiB: 512`**: Default memory allocation. LLM interactions can sometimes be memory-intensive; this will need monitoring.
- **`timeoutSeconds: 60`**: Default request timeout. AI flows can sometimes take longer; this will also need monitoring and potential adjustment.

This update is a crucial first step in ensuring the operational robustness required for ISA as it evolves.
