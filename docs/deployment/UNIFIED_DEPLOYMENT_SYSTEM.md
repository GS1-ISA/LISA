# Unified Deployment System

## Overview

The Unified Deployment System consolidates multiple GitHub Actions workflows into a single, comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that handles building, testing, security scanning, deployment, and rollback operations across multiple environments and platforms.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Unified GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/unified-deployment.yml`)
   - Single entry point for all deployments
   - Supports multiple environments (development, staging, production)
   - Supports multiple platforms (Kubernetes, ECS, Docker)
   - Implements comprehensive security scanning
   - Provides automated rollback capabilities

2. **Deployment Orchestrator** (`scripts/deploy-orchestrator.sh`)
   - Central deployment coordination script
   - Handles environment protection rules
   - Manages deployment strategies
   - Coordinates security scanning
   - Executes health checks and rollbacks

3. **Platform-Specific Scripts**
   - [`scripts/deploy-kubernetes.sh`](scripts/deploy-kubernetes.sh) - Kubernetes deployments
   - [`scripts/deploy-ecs.sh`](scripts/deploy-ecs.sh) - ECS deployments
   - [`scripts/deploy-docker.sh`](scripts/deploy-docker.sh) - Docker deployments
   - [`scripts/health-check.sh`](scripts/health-check.sh) - Health checking
   - [`scripts/rollback-deployment.sh`](scripts/rollback-deployment.sh) - Rollback operations

4. **Configuration Management** (`deployment-config.yaml`)
   - Centralized configuration for all environments
   - Platform-specific settings
   - Security and compliance rules
   - Deployment strategies and approval requirements

## Features

### 1. Multi-Environment Support

The system supports three environments with different protection levels:

- **Development**: Minimal protection, fast iteration
- **Staging**: Moderate protection, pre-production testing
- **Production**: Maximum protection, approval required

### 2. Multi-Platform Support

Deploy to multiple platforms using the same workflow:

- **Kubernetes**: Native Kubernetes deployments with Helm
- **ECS**: AWS ECS with Fargate
- **Docker**: Direct Docker deployments

### 3. Security Integration

Comprehensive security scanning includes:

- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency and container security analysis
- **SARIF**: Standardized security report format
- **Configurable severity thresholds**

### 4. Deployment Strategies

Multiple deployment strategies available:

- **Rolling**: Gradual rollout with zero downtime
- **Blue-Green**: Complete environment switch
- **Canary**: Partial rollout with monitoring
- **Recreate**: Simple replacement strategy

### 5. Environment Protection

Advanced environment protection features:

- **Branch protection**: Deploy only from specified branches
- **Approval gates**: Require manual approval for production
- **Deployment windows**: Restrict deployments to specific time windows
- **OIDC authentication**: Secure AWS authentication
- **Required reviewers**: Enforce code review requirements

### 6. Caching Optimization

Intelligent caching strategies:

- **Docker layer caching**: Speed up container builds
- **Dependency caching**: Cache npm, pip, Maven, Gradle dependencies
- **Multi-platform builds**: Support for AMD64 and ARM64 architectures

### 7. Rollback Capabilities

Automated rollback mechanisms:

- **Health check failure**: Automatic rollback on health check failure
- **Manual rollback**: Trigger rollback via workflow dispatch
- **Deployment history**: Track all deployments for easy rollback
- **State preservation**: Maintain application state during rollback

## Usage

### Automatic Deployment

Deployments are triggered automatically on:

- Push to `main`, `staging`, or `production` branches
- Pull requests to protected branches
- Manual workflow dispatch with custom parameters

### Manual Deployment

Trigger manual deployment via GitHub UI or API:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh workflow run unified-deployment.yml \
  --ref main \
  --field environment=production \
  --field platform=kubernetes \
  --field deployment_strategy=blue-green \
  --field skip_security_scan=false \
  --field force_deployment=false
```

### Configuration

Edit [`deployment-config.yaml`](deployment-config.yaml) to customize:

- Environment-specific settings
- Platform configurations
- Security scanning rules
- Deployment strategies
- Approval requirements

## Workflow Jobs

### 1. Build and Test (`build-and-test`)
- Builds Docker images with multi-platform support
- Pushes images to ECR registry
- Implements comprehensive caching
- Sets up build outputs for subsequent jobs

### 2. Security Scanning (`security-scan`)
- Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner
- Executes Snyk security analysis
- Uploads SARIF results to GitHub Security
- Configurable severity thresholds

### 3. Deployment (`deploy`)
- Executes deployment orchestrator
- Handles environment protection rules
- Manages deployment strategies
- Provides deployment outputs

### 4. Health Check (`health-check`)
- Validates deployment health
- Checks application endpoints
- Verifies service availability
- Triggers rollback on failure

### 5. Rollback (`rollback`)
- Executes automatic rollback
- Restores previous deployment
- Maintains application state
- Provides rollback notifications

### 6. Notification (`notify`)
- Sends deployment status notifications
- Integrates with Slack
- Creates GitHub deployments
- Provides comprehensive status updates

### 7. Cleanup (`cleanup`)
- Removes old container images
- Cleans up deployment artifacts
- Maintains resource hygiene
- Prevents storage accumulation

## Security Features

### OIDC Authentication

The system uses AWS OIDC authentication instead of long-lived credentials:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    role-session-name: github-actions-deploy
    aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
```

### Environment Protection

Configure environment-specific protection rules:

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    approval_required: true
    environment_protection: true
    oidc_required: true
    deployment_branch: main
    deployment_window:
      start: "09:00"
      end: "17:00"
    required_reviewers: 2
```

### Security Scanning

Integrated security scanning with configurable thresholds:

```yaml
security:
  scan_enabled: true
  severity_threshold: high
  fail_on_vulnerabilities: true
  tools:
    - trivy
    - snyk
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Deployment Tracking

- Use OIDC authentication exclusively
- Implement least-privilege IAM roles
- Regular security audits and updates

### 3. Deployment Strategies

- Use rolling deployments for development
- Implement blue-green for staging
- Use canary deployments for production
- Test rollback procedures regularly

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting

- Set up comprehensive health checks
- Monitor deployment metrics
- Configure alerting for failures
- Track deployment frequency and success rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check deployment logs in GitHub Actions
   - Verify AWS credentials and permissions
   - Review configuration in `deployment-config.yaml`
   - Check platform-specific error messages

2. **Security Scan Failures**
   - Review vulnerability reports in GitHub Security
   - Update dependencies to fix vulnerabilities
   - Adjust severity thresholds if needed
   - Whitelist acceptable vulnerabilities

3. **Health Check Failures**
   - Verify application endpoints are accessible
   - Check service configuration and dependencies
   - Review health check script logic
   - Monitor application logs for errors

4. **Rollback Issues**
   - Ensure previous deployment state is preserved
   - Check rollback script permissions
   - Verify rollback target availability
   - Review rollback logs for errors

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-orchestrator.sh \
  --environment production \
  --platform kubernetes \
  --image-tag myapp:latest \
  --verbose
```
