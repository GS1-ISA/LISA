# Unified CI/CD Workflow Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the unified CI/CD workflow architecture that consolidates multiple deployment workflows into a single, comprehensive pipeline. The architecture addresses the issues identified in the original workflows while providing enhanced security, monitoring, and deployment capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The original workflow analysis revealed several critical issues:

1. **Code Duplication**: Multiple workflows contained identical or similar steps
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Hardcoded credentials and inconsistent security scanning
3. **Inefficient Caching**: Suboptimal cache usage leading to longer build times
4. **Limited Rollback**: No systematic rollback mechanisms
5. **Inconsistent Monitoring**: Fragmented monitoring and alerting
6. **Manual Approvals**: Inconsistent approval processes across environments

## Architecture Components

### 1. Unified Workflow Structure

The unified workflow is organized into several key components:

```

├── unified-cicd-pipeline.yml          # Main unified workflow
├── config/
│   ├── deployment-config.yml          # Deployment configuration
│   ├── security-config.yml            # Security scanning configuration
│   ├── oidc-config.yml               # OIDC authentication configuration
│   ├── environment-config.yml        # Environment-specific settings
│   ├── caching-config.yml            # Caching strategies
│   └── monitoring-config.yml         # Monitoring and alerting
├── actions/
│   ├── security-scan/
│   │   └── action.yml                # Reusable security scanning action
│   ├── deploy/
│   │   └── action.yml                # Reusable deployment action
│   └── rollback/
│       └── action.yml                # Reusable rollback action
└── scripts/

### 5. Caching Strategy

#### Multi-level Caching
```yaml
Caching Levels:
  - Dependency Cache: Language-specific dependencies
  - Build Cache: Compiled artifacts and intermediate files
