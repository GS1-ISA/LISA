## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Architecture

The unified CI/CD pipeline follows a modular, event-driven architecture that separates concerns while maintaining tight integration between components. The architecture is designed around the principle of "configure once, deploy anywhere" with environment-specific customization capabilities.

### Core Components

#### 1. Unified Workflow Engine
The central orchestrator that manages the entire CI/CD pipeline execution. It handles:
- Event processing and workflow triggering
- Configuration loading and validation
- Component coordination and dependency management
- Error handling and recovery
- Status reporting and notifications

#### 2. Configuration Manager
Manages all configuration aspects of the pipeline:
- Environment-specific settings
- Security policies and thresholds
- Performance parameters
- Deployment strategies
- Monitoring configurations

#### 3. Security Scanner
Comprehensive security scanning component that integrates multiple tools:
- Container vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Grype)
- Static code analysis (Semgrep)
- Secret detection (TruffleHog)
- Infrastructure scanning (Checkov)
- Compliance checking

#### 4. Build Optimizer
Optimizes build processes through:
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Parallel execution optimization
- Resource utilization optimization
- Build artifact management
- Dependency resolution optimization

#### 5. Deployment Controller
Manages deployment processes across environments:
- Environment-specific deployment strategies
- Health check validation
- Traffic management
- Rollout coordination
- Post-deployment validation

#### 6. Rollback Manager
Handles deployment rollbacks with:
- Automated rollback triggers
- Manual rollback capabilities
- Rollback validation
- State restoration
- Impact assessment

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
All configuration is centralized in the `config/` directory with environment-specific overrides, ensuring consistency and reducing configuration drift.

### 2. Security by Design
Security is integrated at every layer:
- OIDC-based authentication eliminates credential storage
- Security scanning is mandatory and non-bypassable
- Vulnerability thresholds prevent vulnerable deployments
- Compliance checks ensure regulatory requirements are met

### 3. Progressive Deployment
Deployments follow a progressive strategy:
- Development: Continuous deployment with minimal gates
- Staging: Comprehensive testing and validation
- Production: Multi-stage approval and health validation

### 4. Observability First
Comprehensive monitoring and logging:
- Structured logging throughout the pipeline
- Metrics collection for all components
- Alerting for critical issues
- Dashboards for visibility

### 5. Failure Resilience
Built-in resilience mechanisms:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation
- Comprehensive error handling

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

The unified pipeline implements a zero-trust security model with OIDC-based authentication:

#### OIDC Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant GH as GitHub Actions
    participant OP as OIDC Provider
    participant CP as Cloud Provider
    participant RS as Resource Service
    
    GH->>OP: Request OIDC token
    OP->>GH: Issue JWT token
    GH->>CP: Authenticate with JWT
    CP->>OP: Validate token
    OP->>CP: Token validation response
    CP->>GH: Issue temporary credentials
    GH->>RS: Access resources with temp credentials
    RS->>GH: Resource access granted
```

### Security Scanning Integration

The security architecture integrates multiple scanning tools with a unified reporting mechanism:

#### Vulnerability Management
- **Scanning Frequency**: Every build, with nightly deep scans
- **Vulnerability Database**: Updated daily from multiple sources

- **Access Audit**: Complete audit trail for secret access
- **Encryption**: All secrets encrypted at rest and in transit

### Compliance Framework

The pipeline supports multiple compliance frameworks:

- **SOC 2**: Automated evidence collection and reporting
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry compliance checks

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Blue Environment"
        A[Load Balancer]
        B[App v1.0]
        C[Database]
    end
    
    subgraph "Green Environment"
        D[App v2.0]
        E[Database Replica]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    D --> E
    
    style B fill:#90EE90
    style D fill:#FFB6C1
```

**Process:**
1. Deploy new version to Green environment
2. Run health checks and validation tests
3. Switch load balancer to Green environment
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep Blue environment for quick rollback

### Canary Deployment

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load Balancer]
    B[App v1.0 - 90%]
    C[App v2.0 - 10%]
    D[Monitoring]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    C --> D
    
    style B fill:#90EE90
    style C fill:#FFD700
```

**Process:**
1. Deploy new version to small subset of instances (10%)
2. Monitor metrics and error rates
3. Gradually increase traffic to new version
4. Full rollout if metrics are healthy
5. Automatic rollback if issues detected

### Feature Flags Integration

The pipeline supports feature flag integration for progressive feature rollout:

```yaml
feature_flags:
  new_checkout_flow:
    enabled: false
    rollout_percentage: 0
    environments:
      - development
      - staging
  enhanced_search:
    enabled: true
    rollout_percentage: 50
    environments:
      - production
```

## Monitoring & Observability
