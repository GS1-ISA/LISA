# Unified CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the unified CI/CD pipeline architecture that consolidates multiple GitHub Actions workflows into a cohesive, maintainable system. The architecture follows GitHub's recommended best practices for reusable workflows, security, and deployment strategies.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Unified CI/CD Pipeline ([`unified-cicd.yml`](.github/workflows/unified-cicd.yml))

The main entry point that orchestrates the entire CI/CD process:

- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs, releases, manual dispatch
- **Configuration**: Dynamic environment detection and feature flags
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates all sub-workflows
- **Notifications**: Comprehensive status reporting and notifications

### 2. Code Quality Workflow ([`code-quality.yml`](.github/workflows/code-quality.yml))

Standardized security and quality scanning:

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Detection of exposed secrets
- **Results**: SARIF format upload to GitHub Security tab

### 3. Build and Test Workflow ([`build-and-test.yml`](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml))

Comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback on code changes
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation
- **E2E Tests**: Full application testing (production only)
- **Caching**: Optimized dependency caching
- **Parallel Execution**: Matrix strategy for efficiency

### 4. Deployment Staging Workflow ([`deployment-staging.yml`](.github/workflows/deployment-staging.yml))

Production-ready deployment with proper gating:

- **Pre-deployment Checks**: Version consistency and validation
- **Manual Approval**: Environment protection rules
- **Validation**: Post-deployment health checks
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on validation failure
- **Audit Trail**: Complete deployment history

    A[Push/PR/Release] --> B[Workflow Config]
    B --> C[Code Quality]
    C --> D[Build & Test]
    D --> E[Build Image]
    E --> F{Environment?}
    F -->|Staging| G[Deploy Staging]
    F -->|Production| H[Deploy Production]
    G --> I[Validation]
    H --> J[Validation + Approval]
    I --> K[Complete]
    J --> K
```

## Environment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Trigger**: Feature branches, PRs
- **Tests**: Unit tests only
- **Security**: Basic scanning
- **Deployment**: None (build only)

### Staging Environment
- **Trigger**: Main branch merges
- **Tests**: Unit + Integration tests
- **Security**: Full scanning suite
- **Deployment**: Automatic to staging
- **Validation**: Automated health checks

### Production Environment
- **Trigger**: Releases, manual dispatch
- **Tests**: Full test suite (Unit + Integration + E2E)
- **Security**: Comprehensive scanning
- **Deployment**: Manual approval required
- **Validation**: Extended validation period

## Security Features

### OIDC Authentication
- AWS role assumption without long-lived credentials
- Federated identity with GitHub Actions
- Scoped permissions per environment

### Environment Protection
- Required reviewers for production
- Deployment protection rules
- Branch protection policies
- Secret management

### Security Scanning
- **SAST**: Code vulnerability detection
- **Dependency Scanning**: Third-party library vulnerabilities
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability assessment
- **Secret Scanning**: Credential exposure detection

## Caching Strategy

### Dependency Caching
```yaml
cache-key: ${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements*.txt', '**/package-lock.json') }}
```

### Build Caching
- Docker layer caching with GitHub Actions cache
- Multi-platform builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- Cache-to and cache-from optimization

### Test Result Caching
- Test result persistence between runs
- Incremental test execution
- Failed test prioritization

## Deployment Features

### Pre-deployment Validation
- Version consistency checks
- Container image availability verification
- Deployment history validation
- Environment readiness assessment

### Post-deployment Validation
- Health endpoint monitoring
- Performance baseline comparison
- Error rate threshold validation
- Service dependency verification

### Rollback Mechanisms
- Automatic rollback on validation failure
- Manual rollback triggers
- Previous version preservation
- Rollback validation

## Configuration

### Required Secrets
```yaml
# AWS Configuration
AWS_ROLE_ARN: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/GitHubActionsRole"

# External Services
SNYK_TOKEN: "snyk-api-token"
SONAR_TOKEN: "sonar-cloud-token"
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."

# Test Environment
TEST_DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://testuser:testpass@localhost:5432/testdb"
TEST_API_KEY: "test-api-key"
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml
REGISTRY: ghcr.io
IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
PYTHON_VERSION: '3.11'
NODE_VERSION: '18'
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Push Workflow
```bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
# Triggers: Code Quality â†’ Build & Test (Unit only)
```

### Production Release
```bash
gh release create v1.2.3 --title "Release v1.2.3" --notes "Production release"
# Triggers: Full pipeline with production deployment
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
gh workflow run unified-cicd.yml --ref main -f deployment-target=staging
# Triggers: Manual deployment to staging
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### GitHub Integration
- Workflow status badges
- Deployment environments dashboard
- Security alerts integration
- Pull request checks

### Notifications
- Slack notifications on completion
- Email alerts for failures
- GitHub issue creation for incidents
- Deployment summary reports

### Metrics Collection
- Build duration tracking
- Test success rates
- Deployment frequency
- Failure recovery time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Not Triggering**
   - Check branch protection rules
   - Verify workflow file syntax
   - Review trigger conditions

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Verify OIDC role configuration
   - Check repository settings
   - Review secret availability

3. **Test Failures**
   - Check test environment setup
   - Verify dependency installation
   - Review test configuration

4. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check validation endpoints
   - Review deployment logs
   - Verify environment configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting the repository secret:
```yaml
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
- Use reusable workflows for common tasks
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Include timeout configurations

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets
- Use least-privilege permissions
- Enable security scanning
- Regular security audits

### Performance
- Optimize caching strategies
- Use matrix builds for parallelism
- Minimize job dependencies
- Clean up resources

### Maintenance
- Regular workflow updates
- Monitor execution metrics
- Review security alerts
- Update dependencies

## Migration from Legacy Workflows

### Step 1: Audit Existing Workflows
```bash
# List all existing workflows
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/actions/workflows | jq '.workflows[].name'
```

### Step 2: Identify Duplication
- Compare workflow steps
- Identify common patterns
- Document differences

### Step 3: Gradual Migration
1. Implement new reusable workflows
2. Update existing workflows to use new components
3. Test thoroughly in non-production environments
4. Complete migration and remove old workflows

### Step 4: Validation
- Compare execution results
- Verify security scanning coverage
- Test deployment processes
- Validate notifications
