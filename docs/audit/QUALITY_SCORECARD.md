2. **Memory (I):** 67/100 - Below threshold, semantic memory missing

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. Promote security scanning from advisory to enforced
2. Implement semantic memory system
3. Achieve zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
1. Complete cross-OS determinism testing
2. Promote remaining CI gates to enforced
3. Reduce documentation orphan ratio

### Low Priority (Week 5+)
1. Enhance observability correlation
2. Complete council simulation implementation
3. Optimize performance benchmarks

## Recommendations

### Go/No-Go Decision: **CONDITIONAL (AMBER)**

**Conditions for GO:**
1. Security score improved to ≥70/100
2. Memory management score improved to ≥70/100
3. Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
4. All priority remediation actions completed
