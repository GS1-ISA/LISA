# AI Project Charter

## Project Overview

The ISA (Intelligent Systems Architecture) project is designed to create a robust, scalable, and governable AI system that integrates multiple AI agents, memory management, vector storage, and research capabilities. This charter defines the project's scope, objectives, governance structure, and operational guidelines.

## Project Vision

To build an intelligent system architecture that enables autonomous AI agents to collaborate effectively while maintaining transparency, accountability, and alignment with organizational goals.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Agent Orchestration**: Develop a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents can collaborate on complex tasks
2. **Memory Management**: Implement persistent memory systems including vector stores for knowledge retention and retrieval
3. **Research Integration**: Enable agents to conduct research, synthesize information, and generate insights
4. **Governance & Compliance**: Establish clear governance structures and documentation standards
5. **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling and modular component integration

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and metrics collection
2. **Security**: Ensure data privacy and secure operation of AI systems
3. **Extensibility**: Create plugin architectures for easy feature additions
4. **User Experience**: Provide clear interfaces for human oversight and interaction

## Project Scope

- Minimum 80% test coverage for core components
- Documentation required for all public APIs
- Code reviews mandatory for all changes

### AI Model Standards
- Model cards required for all deployed models
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Bias and fairness evaluations conducted
- Security reviews for model integrations

### Data Quality
- Data catalog maintained with full lineage
- Schema validation for all data sources
- Regular data quality audits
- Provenance tracking for all ingested content

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Technical Debt**: Rapid prototyping may lead to maintainability issues
   - **Mitigation**: Regular refactoring sprints, code quality gates

2. **Model Drift**: AI model performance may degrade over time
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, automated retraining pipelines

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: AI systems may be targeted by adversarial attacks
   - **Mitigation**: Security reviews, input validation, access controls

4. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: System may not handle increased load
   - **Mitigation**: Performance testing, horizontal scaling design

5. **Compliance Issues**: May not meet regulatory requirements
   - **Mitigation**: Regular compliance reviews, documentation standards

### Risk Monitoring
