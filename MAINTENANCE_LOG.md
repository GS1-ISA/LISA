Title: Maintenance Log — Full-Spectrum Health-Check
Last updated: 2025-09-02

- Phase 1 (Inventory & Baseline): Completed. Collected repo inventory, commit/branch info, and refreshed SHA-256 manifest via existing audit scripts. Noted that remote PR listing requires network/credentials — proposed CI step to capture on PR.
- Phase 2 (Environment Sanity): Partial. Verified ISA_SuperApp tests and MkDocs build deterministically; secrets scanning delegated to CI (gitleaks). Proposed SBOM+license scan weekly (already configured).
- Phase 3 (Comprehensive Testing): Completed locally for ISA_SuperApp. All tests green; coverage XML generated; advisory no-regression check executed.
- Phase 4 (Debugging & Defect Sweep): Partial. Ran ruff, mypy, bandit, pip-audit. No blockers found; container/runtime sanitizers not applicable in this pass.
- Phase 5 (Performance & Resource Audit): Deferred heavy benches/stress to nightly due to environment constraints; proposed benches and perf budgets.
- Phase 6 (Code Clean-up & Modernisation): Incremental — type hygiene and API robustness earlier in this session; no broad reformat applied.
- Phase 7 (Documentation Integrity): Completed. MkDocs site builds, docs lint clean, cross-links updated.
- Phase 7.5 (Coherence & Interconnection Audit): New artifacts generated (graph, orphans, terms, traceability, scorecard). Auto-fix script scaffolded.
- Phase 8 (Workflow & Governance): Reviewed CI; added nightly/weekly schedules and memory gates. Conventional commits & release-please present.
- Phase 9 (Placeholder & Stub Analysis): Added TODO/coherence scripts; proposed issue creation for flagged items.
- Phase 10 (Quality Scoring & Report Card): Added qualitative scorecard with initial baseline; refine with CI data later.
- Phase 11 (Common-Sense & Edge-Case): Noted risks and mitigations in summary; kill-switch and advisory gates documented.
- Phase 12 (Final Guarantees & Sign-Off): Partial — re-ran tests/types. Git tag/sign requires user credentials; propose performing via CI.
