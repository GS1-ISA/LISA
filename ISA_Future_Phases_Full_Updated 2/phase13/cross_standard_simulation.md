# Phase 13 – Cross-Standard Alignment Simulation Plan

## Objective
Simulate ISA's integration with non-GS1 standards such as FDA-UDI and OpenPEPPOL. Validate interoperability, mapping quality, and contract enforcement.

## Simulation 1: FDA-UDI ↔ GS1 GTIN
- Test mapping UDI-DI to GTIN
- Identify ontology and metadata mismatches
- Track audit trails and feedback loops

## Simulation 2: PEPPOL Invoice ↔ GS1 XML / EPCIS
- Align transaction schema elements (e.g. Item ID, lot)
- Resolve naming conflicts and interpret semantic gaps
- Trigger ISA standard suggestions for harmonization

## Outcomes
- Mapping confidence metrics
- Conflict resolution logs
- Candidate contract templates
