# Phase 12 â€“ Simulation Scenarios

## Scenario 1: CSRD-Driven Fragmentation
EU legislation diverges from global GS1 standard. Test adoption and conflict response.

## Scenario 2: Technology Leap

## Scenario 3: Adoption Stall
GS1 standard update faces resistance from LATAM distributors. Forecast economic impact and countermeasures.

## Scenario 4: Carbon Tax Incentivization
Digital Product Passport adoption spikes due to new CO2 reporting regulations. Test downstream effects.

Each scenario should log:
