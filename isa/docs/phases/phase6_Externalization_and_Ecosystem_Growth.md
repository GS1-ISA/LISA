# Phase 6: Externalization & Ecosystem Growth

## 📌 Purpose
Open ISA to ecosystem participants beyond the core team. Create the frameworks for external integrations, open API access, and multi-stakeholder governance.

## ⚠️ Drift-Responsive Guidance
Phase 6 should *not* assume static infrastructure or ontology. Drift from Phase 4 knowledge graph evolution or Phase 5 agent mutations must be assessed.

## 🌍 Core Goals
- Decentralized identity and access control
- Public GraphQL/REST API for agent queries and audits
- Federation-ready KG sync protocol (for other GS1 MOs, standard bodies)
- Multi-party governance voting
- DAO-configurable access tiers

## 🔄 Maturation Triggers
This document dynamically expands as:
- APIs are exposed from Genkit flows
- Federation metadata appears in the KG
- Voting rules from governance.yaml evolve

## 🚀 Expansion Hooks
- [ ] API gateway requirements
- [ ] DAO-tier definition models
- [ ] Federation protocol compatibility notes
- [ ] Legal/compliance considerations
- [ ] Public engagement plan
