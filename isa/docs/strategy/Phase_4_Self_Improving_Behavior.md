# Phase 4: Self-Improving Agent Behavior

## Objective
Enable ISA to continuously learn from its actions, refine its prompts, evolve agent workflows, and adapt knowledge structures based on feedback and observed failures.

## Core Themes

### 1. Prompt Evolution Feedback Loop
- Monitor CoT trace quality
- Identify prompt patterns that lead to success/failure
- Trigger prompt rewriting agents when feedback scores drop
- Maintain prompt version history

### 2. Dynamic Agent Policy Refinement
- Adapt LangGraph routing decisions based on outcome logs
- Enable agents to suggest new branches, forks, or subgraph expansions
- Store agent behavior metrics in Firestore for trend detection

### 3. KG-Centric Learning
- Log queries that fail due to incomplete knowledge
- Launch research agents to propose KG schema extensions
- Version KG schemas and associate with context snapshots

### 4. Self-Evaluation Simulation Runs
- Use synthetic questions and red-teaming prompts
- Score with LLM judge, dataset evaluator, and human gating
- Update roadmap based on regression or improvement detection

## Tools & Mechanisms
- LangGraph Memory-Influenced Nodes
- Prompt Mutation Agent (PMC)
- Outcome Evaluator Agent (OEA)
- CoT Trace Analyzer
- KG Research Seeder
- Firestore-backed agent feedback DB

## Phase Trigger
Initiate via DAO vote or self-evaluation threshold (e.g., 5 degraded outputs in a row).

## Outputs
- `memory/prompt_versions.json`
- `feedback/trace_scores.json`
- `logs/self_eval_rounds/`
- Updated roadmap entries in `/docs/strategy/ISA_Roadmap.md`

## Known Challenges
- Prompt drift and overfitting
- Long-term memory bias
- Need for balance between autonomy and stability
