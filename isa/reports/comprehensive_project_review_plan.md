# Project Review Plan

**Objective:** Generate a markdown report outlining inconsistencies, gaps, or areas requiring attention in the ISA project's documentation and structure, with recommendations for next steps.

**Phases of Review:**

#### Phase 1: Information Gathering & Initial Assessment (Completed)
*   Read `isa/context/ISA_Roadmap.md` and `isa/config/roo_mode_map.json`.
*   Analyzed the provided file system structure from `environment_details`.
*   Identified initial inconsistencies and gaps.

#### Phase 2: Detailed Analysis and Inconsistency Identification

1.  **Roadmap Completeness Check**:
    *   **Action**: Re-examine `isa/context/ISA_Roadmap.md` to confirm all "TBD" sections (Timelines, Key Firebase Actions/Adjustments, Key Metrics for Firebase) for Phases 4-18.
    *   **Expected Outcome**: A clear list of phases lacking detailed planning.
    *   **Inconsistency/Gap**: Significant "TBD" sections indicate a lack of detailed long-term planning.

2.  **Mode Map Consistency Check**:
    *   **Action**: Review `isa/config/roo_mode_map.json` for naming convention consistency (e.g., `ROO-MODE-RESEARCH` vs. `Orchestrator`).
    *   **Expected Outcome**: Identification of modes with inconsistent naming.
    *   **Inconsistency/Gap**: Minor naming inconsistencies.

3.  **Core Documentation Presence & Alignment**:
    *   **Action**: Verify the existence and content of critical governance and architecture documents mentioned in global instructions: `isa/context/governance.md` and `isa/context/ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`. Also, check for `isa/roo_modes.md` as per global instruction #3.
    *   **Expected Outcome**: Confirmation of presence/absence and a high-level assessment of their content's relevance and completeness.
    *   **Inconsistency/Gap**: `isa_manifest.yaml` was explicitly noted as missing. `isa/roo_modes.md` was not found in the initial file list.

4.  **Project Directory Structure Coherence**:
    *   **Action**: Analyze the top-level directories in `environment_details` (e.g., `github-ISA-FullStack-Synced/`, `ISA_Future_Phases_Complete 2/`, `ISA_Phase4_SyncPack/`).
    *   **Expected Outcome**: Identification of redundant or conflicting project roots.
    *   **Inconsistency/Gap**: Multiple seemingly redundant project directories suggest disorganization and potential for version conflicts.

5.  **Global Instruction Adherence Check**:
    *   **Action**: Cross-reference the current state of the project (based on file presence and content) with the "Global Instructions" provided in the custom instructions, specifically focusing on logging, validation, and versioning mechanisms.
    *   **Expected Outcome**: A list of global instructions that are not fully met or where implementation is unclear.
    *   **Inconsistency/Gap**: The missing `isa_manifest.yaml` directly violates global instruction #3 and #9.

#### Phase 3: Report Generation

1.  **Structure the Report**: Create a markdown report (`isa/reports/project_review_report.md`) with the following sections:
    *   **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of findings.
    *   **Current State Overview**: Summarize the project's documentation and structure.
    *   **Identified Inconsistencies and Gaps**:
        *   Missing `isa_manifest.yaml` (Critical)
        *   Incomplete `ISA_Roadmap.md` (Phases 4-18 "TBD")
        *   Redundant Project Directories (e.g., `github-ISA-FullStack-Synced/`, `ISA_Future_Phases_Complete 2/`)
        *   Inconsistent Mode Naming in `roo_mode_map.json`
        *   Missing `isa/roo_modes.md` (if confirmed)
        *   Other documentation gaps (e.g., `governance.md`, `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md` content assessment).
    *   **Recommendations for Next Steps**:
        *   **High Priority**: Create a foundational `isa_manifest.yaml`.
        *   **High Priority**: Consolidate redundant project directories into a single, authoritative root.
        *   **Medium Priority**: Detail "TBD" sections in `ISA_Roadmap.md` for future phases.
        *   **Medium Priority**: Standardize mode naming conventions in `roo_mode_map.json`.
        *   **Medium Priority**: Review and enhance `isa/context/governance.md` and `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`. Address `isa/roo_modes.md` if missing.
        *   **Low Priority**: Verify and ensure full integration of `isa_validator.py` and `isa_summarizer.py` into CI/CD.
    *   **Conclusion**: Summarize the importance of addressing these areas for project health and future development.

2.  **Mermaid Diagram (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   Consider including a simple Mermaid diagram to visualize the proposed consolidated project structure or the flow of documentation updates.
