# Development Process Health and Quality Priorities

This report synthesizes the key priorities and practices for maintaining the health and quality of the development process within the ISA project, as derived from the global instructions. These mechanisms ensure consistency, traceability, and self-governing behavior across all development modes.

## 1. Validation Procedures

**Priority:** Ensure the consistency and integrity of the codebase and system state after any modifications.

*   **Mechanism:** After any `Code` or `Architect` action, the `isa_validator.py` script must be run to validate consistency.
*   **Importance:** This proactive validation step helps catch errors early, prevents the introduction of inconsistencies, and maintains the overall stability of the project. The result of this validation is logged for traceability.

## 2. Comprehensive Logging and Reporting

**Priority:** Maintain detailed and comprehensive logs of all development activities and system changes, and provide clear summaries and reports.

*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Mandatory Post-Edit Logging:** Every modified or added file must trigger updates to `CHANGELOG.md`, `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`, and `isa/versions/version_tracker.json`.
    *   **Comprehensive Logging:** All actions must log the active mode, affected file(s), task description, validator outcome, and any milestone impact.
    *   **System-Wide Change Summarization:** If more than two files are changed, `isa_summarizer.py` must be invoked to summarize the system-wide change, with the summary stored in `status_dashboard.md`.
*   **Importance:** Robust logging provides a complete audit trail, enabling traceability, debugging, and understanding the evolution of the project. Summarization and reporting offer high-level overviews, crucial for project management and stakeholder communication.

## 3. Error Escalation and Task Management

**Priority:** Implement clear procedures for handling incomplete tasks, uncertainties, and validation failures to ensure continuous progress and problem resolution.

*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Incomplete Task Requeuing:** If a prompt lacks an `expected_outcome`, the output does not match the `output_type`, or the task is recursive, unclear, or failed, the task must be requeued using the Boomerang pipeline.
    *   **Uncertainty Escalation:** If the outcome of an action is uncertain or validation fails, input and output must be routed to `isa_debugger` for further investigation.
*   **Importance:** These mechanisms prevent tasks from getting stuck, ensure that issues are addressed systematically, and provide a clear path for debugging and resolution when unexpected situations arise.

## 4. Version Control and Rollback Strategies

**Priority:** Safeguard the project's state through versioning and enable quick recovery from critical failures.

*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Milestone Snapshots:** When `CHANGELOG.md` shows a completed milestone section, a snapshot must be triggered to `isa/versions/` and the version bumped in `version_tracker.json`.
    *   **Rollback on Validation Failure:** If the validator fails, the system must revert to the last file-based snapshot in `isa/versions/`, and the rollback reason must be logged in `project_journal.md`.
*   **Importance:** Version control and rollback capabilities are critical for maintaining project stability, allowing for safe experimentation, and ensuring that the system can recover gracefully from errors or unintended changes.

## 5. System Health Monitoring and Configuration Integrity

**Priority:** Continuously monitor system health, ensure the integrity of configurations, and prevent deviations from established prompt behaviors.

*   **Mechanisms:**
    *   **Dashboard Updates for Config Changes:** Any changes to model assignments, autonomy, memory routing, or mode structure must trigger updates to `isa/reports/status_dashboard.md` and `roo_health_report.json`.
    *   **Prompt Drift Avoidance:** All mode behavior must be anchored using `isa/prompts/unified_autopilot.json`, and the system prompt must be audited for deviations from this inheritance contract.
*   **Importance:** Regular monitoring of system health and strict adherence to configuration and prompt integrity prevent system degradation, ensure predictable behavior, and maintain the overall reliability and consistency of the development environment.

These priorities collectively form the backbone of a robust and resilient development process, ensuring high quality, traceability, and efficient problem-solving within the ISA project.
