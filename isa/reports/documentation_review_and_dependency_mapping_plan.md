# Detailed Plan for Documentation Review and Dependency Mapping

**Objective:** To provide a comprehensive analysis of the ISA project documentation's coherence, completeness, and alignment with the roadmap and architectural vision, including a visual dependency map.

---

#### **Phase 1: Information Gathering and Initial Analysis**

1.  **Review `docs/blueprint.md`:**
    *   Extract the "Summary Roadmap Table" (lines 334-339) to understand the high-level phases (Phase 1, 2, 3) and their key features/priorities.
    *   Identify key architectural components and their descriptions, especially those mentioned for Phase 2 (e.g., Vector Data Storage, KG Implementation, ELTVRE).
    *   Note any explicit mentions of Phase 2's missing details (e.g., "detailed plans for real vector store integration, specific KG schema design, and ELTVRE implementation details beyond the high-level overview").
    *   List all key terms and acronyms used throughout the document for a completeness check.

2.  **Review `docs/folder_phase_map.md`:**
    *   Extract the mapping of folders to phases.
    *   Note the mention of "Phases 10–18" for `/ISA_Future_Phases_*` to identify potential discrepancies with `docs/blueprint.md`.

3.  **Review `ISA_Full_System_Export/ISA_Future_Phases/phase11/README.md` and `ISA_Full_System_Export/ISA_Future_Phases/phase12/README.md`:**
    *   Extract the brief descriptions for Phase 11 and Phase 12.
    *   Compare these with the `docs/blueprint.md` roadmap table, which currently only details up to Phase 3.

---

#### **Phase 2: Consistency and Completeness Checks**

1.  **Global Consistency Check:**
    *   **Roadmap Alignment:**
        *   **Action:** Compare the "Summary Roadmap Table" in `docs/blueprint.md` with the content of `ISA_Full_System_Export/ISA_Future_Phases/phase11/README.md` and `ISA_Full_System_Export/ISA_Future_Phases/phase12/README.md`.
        *   **Expected Finding:** `docs/blueprint.md`'s summary table only covers up to Phase 3, while other documents and folder structures indicate phases up to 18. This is a clear inconsistency.
        *   **Action:** Cross-reference the phases and their descriptions in `docs/blueprint.md` with the folder mappings in `docs/folder_phase_map.md`.
        *   **Expected Finding:** `docs/folder_phase_map.md` mentions `ISA_Future_Phases_*` for "Phases 10–18", which aligns with the existence of `phase11` and `phase12` documents, but highlights the `blueprint.md`'s summary table as incomplete.
    *   **Architectural Coherence:**
        *   **Action:** Verify that "Vector Data Storage," "KG Implementation," and "ELTVRE" (from `docs/blueprint.md` Section II.B.1) are consistently described and supported across the relevant phase documentation.
        *   **Expected Finding:** `docs/blueprint.md` provides a high-level overview and conceptual designs for these components within Phase 2. The current `phase11` and `phase12` READMEs are too brief to offer further architectural details, suggesting a potential gap in detailed architectural coherence for later phases.

2.  **Documentation Completeness Assessment:**
    *   **Missing Documentation for Phase 2:**
        *   **Action:** Specifically search `docs/blueprint.md` (Section II.B.1) for explicit statements about missing details for real vector store integration, specific KG schema design, and ELTVRE implementation.
        *   **Expected Finding:** `docs/blueprint.md` explicitly states that these are areas needing further detail, confirming the incompleteness.
    *   **Clear Definitions for Key Terms/Acronyms:**
        *   **Action:** Review the list of terms/acronyms identified in Phase 1.1. Assess if `docs/blueprint.md` provides sufficient definitions or if a dedicated glossary is needed.
        *   **Expected Finding:** While some terms are explained in context, a centralized glossary is not present, which could lead to ambiguity for new contributors.

#### **Phase 3: Dependency Mapping (Mermaid Diagram)**

1.  **Identify Key Entities:**
    *   **Phases:** Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 (from `blueprint.md`), and conceptual higher phases (e.g., Phase 11, Phase 12) as indicated by folder structure.
    *   **Architectural Components:** Frontend, Backend Logic (Genkit), Data Storage (Vector Store, KG), AI/ML Layer (LLMs, Embeddings, Document AI, MLOps), Authentication, Monitoring, Optional Specialized Compute.
    *   **Key Processes:** Data Ingestion (ELTVRE), RAG Pipeline, KG Population, Advanced AI Features.

2.  **Map Dependencies:**
    *   **Action:** Analyze `docs/blueprint.md` (especially Sections II and III) to identify how phases build upon each other and how architectural components are prerequisites for certain features.
    *   **Example Dependencies:**
        *   Phase 1 (Foundational) -> Phase 2 (Infrastructure Maturation) -> Phase 3 (Scalable Vision).
        *   Real Vector Store & KG Implementation (Phase 2 Infrastructure) -> KG-RAG Integration & Advanced Reasoning (Phase 2 AI Features).
        *   Advanced Data Ingestion (ELTVRE) -> High-Quality Vector Store & KG Population.
        *   MLOps Foundation (Phase 2) -> Automated RAG Index Updates & KG Construction.
        *   Frontend & Backend Logic (App Hosting, Genkit) are foundational across all phases.

3.  **Create Mermaid Diagram:**
    *   **Action:** Construct a Mermaid `graph TD` diagram to visually represent these dependencies.
    *   **Highlight:** Critical paths (e.g., infrastructure maturation enabling advanced AI) and potential bottlenecks (e.g., lack of detailed ELTVRE plan impacting data quality).

#### **Phase 4: Tooling & Process Alignment Review**

1.  **Review Global Custom Instructions:**
    *   Go through each point in the "Global Instructions" provided in the prompt (e.g., Validate Runtime Environment, Mandatory Post-Edit Logging, Path Discipline, Respect .rooignore, Run `isa_validator.py` Post-Edit, Create Snapshots After Milestones, Comprehensive Logging Required).

2.  **Compare with Project Documentation:**
    *   **Action:** Check `docs/blueprint.md` for mentions of logging, CI/CD, security, and general operational practices.
    *   **Action:** Check the file structure and existing files (e.g., `CHANGELOG.md`, `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`, `isa/versions/version_tracker.json`, `isa_manifest.yaml`) to see if the mechanisms for these instructions are in place or documented.
    *   **Expected Findings:**
        *   `docs/blueprint.md` mentions CI/CD outline, basic monitoring, and secrets management, which aligns with some instructions.
        *   The presence of `CHANGELOG.md`, `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`, `isa/versions/version_tracker.json`, and `isa_manifest.yaml` suggests an intent to comply with logging, versioning, and manifest updates.
        *   However, explicit documentation on *how* these global instructions are enforced (e.g., the exact process for `isa_validator.py` or `isa_summarizer.py` execution, or the mechanism for context restoration) might be missing or scattered. The `blueprint.md` focuses more on product features and architecture than on agent operational procedures.

#### **Phase 5: Report Generation**

1.  **Compile Findings:**
    *   Synthesize all observations from the consistency, completeness, and alignment checks into a detailed markdown report.
    *   Structure the report according to the four main points of the task.
    *   Clearly highlight identified gaps, inconsistencies, and areas for further definition.
    *   Include the generated Mermaid diagram.
