## Detailed Plan for Enhancing AI Flows and Tooling:

### Phase 1: Enhancing Existing AI Flows (Refinement & Expansion)

1.  **Enhance `conduct-independent-research.ts` with Summarization:**
    *   **Goal:** Integrate a summarization capability into the independent research flow to provide concise overviews of findings.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Develop a new AI tool for text summarization (see Phase 2).
        *   Modify `conduct-independent-research.ts` to utilize this new summarization tool after gathering information.
        *   Consider integrating with an external summarization API via MCP if an internal solution is insufficient.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Research results will include an automatically generated summary.

2.  **Improve `detect-standard-errors.ts` Accuracy and Scope:**
    *   **Goal:** Enhance the accuracy of error detection and expand the types of standards it can analyze.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Refine the underlying models or logic used for error detection.
        *   Potentially integrate with external knowledge bases or validation services via MCP for more comprehensive standard adherence checks.
        *   Improve feedback mechanisms for detected errors.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** More reliable and broader error detection capabilities.

3.  **Optimize `answer-gs1-questions-with-vector-search.ts` for Complex Queries:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve the flow's ability to handle multi-part questions, nuanced queries, and synthesize information from multiple document chunks.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Explore advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques.
        *   Enhance the `queryVectorStoreTool` to support more sophisticated query transformations or multi-stage retrieval.
        *   Potentially integrate with a more advanced semantic parsing API via MCP.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** More accurate and comprehensive answers to complex GS1-related questions.

### Phase 2: Developing New AI Tools

1.  **New Tool: Content Summarization Tool:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a reusable AI tool for generating concise summaries from long texts.
    *   **Functionality:** Input text, output summary.
    *   **Implementation:** Could be a new TypeScript file in `src/ai/tools/`, potentially leveraging an existing LLM or a dedicated summarization model.
    *   **Integration:** Will be used by `conduct-independent-research.ts` and potentially other flows.

2.  **New Tool: Data Extraction & Transformation Tool:**
    *   **Goal:** Develop a tool capable of extracting structured data from unstructured text and transforming it into a desired format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    *   **Functionality:** Input unstructured text and a schema/template, output structured data.
    *   **Implementation:** A new TypeScript file in `src/ai/tools/`, potentially using regex, LLM-based extraction, or integrating with a specialized document parsing API via MCP.
    *   **Use Case:** Could be used to process reports, articles, or other documents for populating the Knowledge Graph or other databases.

### Phase 3: Integrating Additional External APIs via MCP

1.  **New MCP Server: Web Search API Integration:**
    *   **Goal:** Provide real-time, up-to-date information retrieval capabilities to AI flows.
    *   **API Examples:** Google Search API, Brave Search API (already present in `Cline/MCP/sqlite-mcp-server/servers/src/brave-search/`), Bing Search API.
    *   **Purpose:** Enhance `conduct-independent-research.ts` and other flows requiring current information beyond the indexed vector store.
    *   **Implementation:** Create a new MCP server (e.g., `web-search-server`) that exposes a tool to perform web searches and return results.

2.  **New MCP Server: Public Data API Integration:**
    *   **Goal:** Access a wide range of public datasets for enriched analysis and insights.
    *   **API Examples:** Government data portals, open-source data repositories, financial data APIs, demographic data APIs.
    *   **Purpose:** Support `analyze-standards.ts` with external context, or enable new analytical flows.
    *   **Implementation:** Create a new MCP server (e.g., `public-data-server`) that provides tools to query specific public data sources.

3.  **Leverage Existing `document-ai` MCP Server:**
    *   **Goal:** Fully integrate the existing `document-ai` MCP server into relevant AI flows.
    *   **Purpose:** Enhance document processing capabilities, such as OCR, entity extraction, or document classification, for flows like `answer-gs1-questions` or `detect-standard-errors`.
    *   **Action:** Identify specific use cases within existing flows where document AI can add value and modify those flows to call the `document-ai` tools.

### Phase 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns & Infrastructure

1.  **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   **Goal:** Implement more detailed logging for AI flow execution, tool usage, and API calls to facilitate debugging, performance monitoring, and auditing.
    *   **Approach:** Utilize `src/lib/logger.ts` consistently across all new and modified components.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved observability of AI system behavior.

2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Goal:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks in AI flows and tools.
    *   **Approach:** Profile existing flows, optimize database queries (Neo4j), improve vector search efficiency, and consider caching mechanisms.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** Faster response times and reduced resource consumption.

3.  **Security Review:**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure all new tools and API integrations adhere to security best practices, especially regarding API key management (using `src/lib/secretManager.ts`) and data privacy.
    *   **Approach:** Conduct a security audit of new components and integrations.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** A secure and robust AI system.
