*   **Varying Detail Levels:** For phases 11-14, the `ISA_Full_System_Export/ISA_Future_Phases/phaseXX/README.md` files provide very high-level descriptions, while other files (e.g., `ISA_Future_Phases_Complete 2/phase11/phase11.md`, `ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated 2/phase12/phase12.md`) offer more detailed objectives, features, and components. This indicates that some phases have more comprehensive documentation than others.
*   **Incomplete Information:** Some phases (15-18) currently only have very brief descriptions, suggesting that detailed planning for these later phases is still in its early stages or not yet fully documented.
