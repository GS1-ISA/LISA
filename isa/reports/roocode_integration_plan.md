# Plan for Integrating Roocode Protocol Concepts into ISA Architecture

This plan outlines the integration of key agentic concepts from "The 'Roocode' Protocol" report into the existing ISA architecture, focusing on enhancing autonomy, intelligence, and operational rigor.

## 1. Key Concepts to Integrate

The most impactful concepts from the "Roocode Protocol" report for integration into ISA are:

*   **PPAM Operational Cycle (Perception, Planning, Action, Memory)**: A foundational modular cognitive architecture for autonomous agents.
*   **Multi-Modal Knowledge Gap Detection**: Programmatic methods for identifying and quantifying knowledge deficiencies (Intrinsic Uncertainty Quantification, Collaborative Probing, Heuristic-Based Gap Identification).
*   **Automated Cost-Benefit Analysis for Research Prioritization**: Quantifying research costs and benefits to prioritize tasks efficiently.
*   **Tiered Strategy for Browser Access**: Dynamic selection of browser access technologies (e.g., Anthropic's `web_search`, Playwright MCP, `computer_use` tool, BaaS APIs) based on task requirements and cost.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline**: A comprehensive pipeline for knowledge ingestion, chunking, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and augmentation to ground LLM responses.
*   **Stateful Graph Framework (LangGraph)**: For orchestrating complex, multi-actor LLM applications, managing state, cycles, and conditional branches.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Checkpoints**: Mechanisms for human oversight, approval, and feedback integration at critical junctures.
*   **Operational Rigor (Structured Logging, Performance Metrics, Iterative Refinement)**: Essential practices for debugging, analysis, and continuous improvement.
*   **Self-Improving Systems**: The concept of agents learning to improve their own operational logic and fine-tune models based on experience.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Enabling specialized agents to collaborate on complex problems.

## 2. Architectural Impact

Integrating these concepts will significantly evolve the ISA architecture, introducing new modules and modifying existing components.

#### Detailed Architectural Changes:

*   **Orchestration Layer**:
    *   Introduce a dedicated `LangGraph`-based orchestration layer (`isa/core/orchestrator.py`) to manage the flow between PPAM modules, handle state, and implement conditional logic. This will replace or significantly augment existing task delegation mechanisms.
*   **Perception Module**:
    *   Enhance existing input processing to include more sophisticated interpretation of internal knowledge state and external data. This might involve new components for parsing diverse data formats from web sources.
*   **Planning Module**:
    *   **Knowledge Gap Detection**: Develop new sub-modules (`isa/planning/gap_detection/`) for `Intrinsic Uncertainty Quantification` (e.g., using ensemble LLM calls or confidence scoring), `Collaborative Probing` (e.g., a critic agent workflow), and `Heuristic-Based Gap Identification` (e.g., regex patterns for missing context/specifications).
    *   **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Implement a `CostEstimator` and `BenefitEstimator` (`isa/planning/cost_benefit/`) that integrate with MCP tool usage logs and knowledge base metrics to generate a `PrioritizationScore`.
    *   **Research Question Formulation**: Refine the prompt engineering for the planning LLM to explicitly generate actionable research questions based on identified gaps.
*   **Action Module**:
    *   **Tiered Browser Access**: Implement a `BrowserAccessManager` (`isa/action/browser_access.py`) that dynamically selects between existing MCPs (e.g., Puppeteer/Playwright MCP for headless browsing) and potentially integrates with Anthropic's native `web_search` or `computer_use` tools via the `unified_autopilot.json` prompt.
    *   **Sandboxed Execution**: Formalize the requirement for browser actions to run within isolated Docker containers, potentially managed by a new `DockerManager` utility.
*   **Memory Module**:
    *   **RAG Pipeline**: Strengthen the existing RAG implementation (`isa/indexing/`) to cover the full lifecycle:
        *   **Ingestion & Parsing**: Enhance `file_extractor.py` and `code_parser.py` to handle more diverse web content (HTML, JSON).
        *   **Chunking**: Refine `code_parser.py` or introduce a new `text_chunker.py` for semantic chunking.
        *   **Embedding Generation**: Ensure `embedder.py` is robust and scalable.
        *   **Vector Storage & Indexing**: Leverage and potentially optimize the existing vector database integration (`isa/architecture/vector_data_storage.md`).
        *   **Retrieval & Augmentation**: Improve `search_interface.py` and `run_semantic_search.py` for more intelligent retrieval.
    *   **Automated Knowledge Refresh**: Implement scheduled tasks (`isa/memory/refresh_scheduler.py`) for re-scraping, change detection (e.g., using content hashes), and data versioning within the vector store.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**:
    *   Integrate `HITLCheckpoints` (`isa/core/hitl_manager.py`) within the LangGraph workflow, allowing the system to pause and request human approval for high-cost actions, sensitive operations, or when uncertainty is high. This will require new UI/API endpoints for human interaction.
*   **Operational Rigor**:
    *   **Structured Logging**: Enforce and expand structured logging across all modules, capturing `Reasoning`, `Action`, `Observation`, `Tool Calls`, and `State Transitions` in a consistent format (e.g., `isa/logs/agent_activity.json`).
    *   **Performance Metrics**: Develop a `MetricsCollector` (`isa/monitoring/metrics.py`) to track task success rates, token consumption, knowledge gaps resolved, and HITL intervention rates.
    *   **Iterative Refinement**: Establish a feedback loop where performance metrics and human feedback inform prompt refinement and heuristic adjustments.
*   **Self-Improvement & Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
    *   These are longer-term goals but will influence the design of the LangGraph orchestration to allow for future integration of specialized agents and automated fine-tuning pipelines.

Significant updates to existing architectural documents and potentially new design documents will be required to reflect these changes.

*   `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`: This document will require a major revision to incorporate the PPAM cycle as the core cognitive architecture, detailing the new modules (Perception, Planning, Action, Memory) and their interactions. It should include updated diagrams (like the one above) and descriptions of the LangGraph orchestration.
*   `isa/context/governance.md`: This document will need updates to reflect the new operational policies, especially regarding `Human-in-the-Loop` checkpoints, cost management, and the enhanced logging requirements. It should also cover the principles of `Autonomy`, `Adaptability`, `Goal-Oriented Behavior`, and `Continuous Learning` as core tenets.
*   `isa_manifest.yaml`: This file will need to be updated to reflect any new core components, dependencies, or configuration parameters introduced by the new modules.
*   **New Document**: `isa/architecture/agentic_workflow_design.md`: A new detailed design document specifically for the LangGraph implementation, outlining the graph structure, node definitions, state management, and conditional edges.
*   **New Document**: `isa/architecture/knowledge_gap_detection_spec.md`: A detailed specification for the multi-modal knowledge gap detection mechanisms, including algorithms, heuristics, and integration points.
*   **New Document**: `isa/architecture/tiered_browser_access_strategy.md`: A document outlining the rationale, implementation details, and selection criteria for the tiered browser access approach.

## 5. Prioritization

The integration efforts should be prioritized to build a stable foundation before introducing more complex functionalities.

1.  **High Priority (Foundational)**:
    *   **PPAM Operational Cycle & LangGraph Orchestration**: This is the core framework that all other agentic concepts will build upon.
    *   **RAG Pipeline Enhancements**: A robust memory system is crucial for accurate and grounded responses.
    *   **Structured Logging & Basic Monitoring**: Essential for debugging and understanding agent behavior from day one.

2.  **Medium Priority (Core Agentic Capabilities)**:
    *   **Multi-Modal Knowledge Gap Detection**: Enables the agent to proactively identify what it doesn't know.
    *   **Automated Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Crucial for efficient and economically rational research.
    *   **Tiered Browser Access & Sandboxing**: Optimizes action execution and enhances security.
    *   **Automated Knowledge Refresh**: Ensures the knowledge base remains current.

3.  **Lower Priority (Advanced Features & Refinement)**:
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Checkpoints**: While important for safety, can be integrated once the core autonomous loop is stable.
    *   **Self-Improving Systems**: Requires significant data collection and analysis from the operational rigor phase.
    *   **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: A future-state goal that builds on a mature single-agent architecture.

This plan provides a roadmap for transforming ISA into a more autonomous, intelligent, and robust agentic system, leveraging the insights from the "Roocode Protocol" report.
