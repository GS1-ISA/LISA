# Plan to Ensure LangChain.js and LangGraph.js are Usable with Yarn

## Objective
The objective is to confirm the correct setup of LangChain.js, LangGraph.js, and `@langchain/community` using `yarn` and prepare for their integration into the project.

## Phase 1: Project Analysis and Verification (Current Mode: Architect)

1.  **Verify Existing Installation**:
    *   Confirm that `@langchain/core` and `@langchain/langgraph` are properly installed and linked via `yarn`. This will involve running `yarn install`.
    *   Check for the presence of `yarn.lock` to ensure `yarn` is the package manager in use.
2.  **Assess `tsconfig.json`**: Reconfirm that `tsconfig.json` is correctly configured for module resolution and type checking.

## Phase 2: Installation/Confirmation and Configuration (Delegated to Code Mode)

1.  **Execute `yarn install`**: Run `yarn install` to ensure all existing dependencies, including `@langchain/core` and `@langchain/langgraph`, are correctly installed and their `node_modules` are set up.
2.  **Add `@langchain/community`**: Use `yarn add @langchain/community` to install this package.
3.  **Initial Project Build/Test**: Run `yarn build` or `next build` (as indicated in `package.json` scripts) to verify that the project compiles without errors after dependency setup.

## Phase 3: Integration and Verification (Delegated to Code Mode)

1.  **Code Integration Guidance**: Provide examples and guidance on how to import and use the LangChain.js and LangGraph.js functionalities within the TypeScript files, focusing on the `src/ai` directory.
2.  **Post-Installation Validation**:
    *   Execute project-specific tests or development server (`yarn dev`) to confirm runtime functionality.
3.  **Documentation and Logging**:
    *   Update `CHANGELOG.md` to record the dependency verification/addition.
    *   Log the task completion in `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`.
    *   Update `isa/versions/version_tracker.json` if this is a significant architectural change.
    *   Run `isa_validator.py` to ensure overall project consistency.
    *   Update `isa/reports/status_dashboard.md` to reflect the system-wide change.
