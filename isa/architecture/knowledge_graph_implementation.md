# Knowledge Graph Implementation Design

## Objective

This document covers the Knowledge Graph (KG) schema/ontology design, storage solution choice (AlloyDB AI or a dedicated graph database on GCP), and initial ETL processes for populating the KG with entities and relationships from GS1 standards.

## KG Schema/Ontology Design

(Details about the designed KG schema and ontology, including entities, relationships, attributes, and their definitions, will be specified here. This may include conceptual models, logical models, and examples.)

## Storage Solution Choice

(Details about the chosen storage solution for the Knowledge Graph, whether it's AlloyDB AI or a dedicated graph database on GCP, along with the rationale for the choice, will be specified here.)

## Initial ETL Processes

(Details about the initial Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes designed to populate the KG with entities and relationships extracted from GS1 standards documents will be specified here. This includes data sources, transformation rules, and loading mechanisms.)

## Integration with RAG System and Advanced AI Features

(Details on how the Knowledge Graph will integrate with the RAG system and support advanced AI features like NeSy (Neuro-Symbolic AI) will be specified here.)

## Scalability, Performance, and Maintenance

(Discussion on scalability considerations, performance optimization strategies, and maintenance procedures for the Knowledge Graph will be included here.)

## Security and Data Governance

(Details on security measures, access control, data encryption, and compliance with data governance policies for the Knowledge Graph will be specified here.)
