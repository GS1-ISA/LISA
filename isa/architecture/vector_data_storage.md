# Vector Data Storage Design

## Objective

This document details the chosen vector database service setup, Genkit tool implementation, and integration with the `answerGs1QuestionsWithVectorSearch` flow for the ISA project.

## Chosen Vector Database Service

(Details about the chosen vector database service, e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or a managed service like AlloyDB AI, will be specified here.)

## Genkit Tool Implementation

(Details about the Genkit tool that connects to the vector database service, replacing any current mock implementations, will be specified here. This includes the tool's API, input/output schemas, and core logic.)

## Integration with `answerGs1QuestionsWithVectorSearch` Flow

(Details on how the `answerGs1QuestionsWithVectorSearch` flow will be updated to utilize the real Genkit tool and vector database service will be specified here. This includes code examples, configuration changes, and testing procedures.)

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

(Discussion on scalability, performance, indexing strategies, and cost optimization for the vector data storage will be included here.)

## Security and Data Governance

(Details on security measures, access control, data encryption, and compliance with data governance policies for the vector data will be specified here.)
