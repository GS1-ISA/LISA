### **Multi-Modal Understanding Plan for ISA**

#### **1. Research on Multi-Modal LLMs and Vision Models**

**Objective:** Identify suitable multi-modal LLMs or vision models capable of processing images, diagrams, and tables from standards documents, and understand their strengths, limitations, and integration requirements.

**Key Research Areas:**

*   **Model Capabilities:**
    *   **Image Understanding:** Models capable of visual question answering (VQA), object detection, scene understanding, and general image captioning.
    *   **Diagram Interpretation:** Models that can parse flowcharts, architectural diagrams, circuit diagrams, and other visual representations to extract relationships and components.
    *   **Table Extraction:** Models proficient in identifying tables within documents, extracting their structure (rows, columns, headers), and content, even from complex or scanned documents.
    *   **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** Robust OCR capabilities for converting text within images/diagrams/tables into machine-readable text.
*   **Leading Models/Frameworks:**
    *   **OpenAI's GPT-4V (Vision):** Known for strong general-purpose visual understanding and VQA.
    *   **Google's Gemini (Pro Vision):** Integrated multi-modal capabilities, potentially strong for complex document understanding.
    *   **Hugging Face Transformers (Vision Models):** Explore models like LayoutLM, Donut, or other specialized models for document AI tasks (e.g., form understanding, table extraction).
    *   **Open-source alternatives:** Investigate models like LLaVA, Fuyu, or other research-backed models that could be fine-tuned.
*   **Integration Considerations:**
    *   API availability and cost.
    *   On-premise deployment feasibility vs. cloud services.
    *   Latency and throughput for real-time processing.
    *   Data privacy and security implications.
    *   Compatibility with existing ISA architecture (e.g., Python, TypeScript, vector databases).

#### **2. Proposed Data Preprocessing Pipeline for Non-Textual Data**

**Objective:** Design a robust pipeline to extract, process, and prepare non-textual elements from various document formats (primarily PDF) for input into multi-modal models.

**Pipeline Stages:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Standards Document (PDF)] --> B{Document Parsing & Page Extraction};
    B --> C{Image/Diagram/Table Detection};
    C --> D{Element Extraction};
    D --> E{OCR & Text Overlay};
    E --> F{Structured Data Conversion};
    F --> G[Multi-Modal Model Input];
    G --> H[Vector Embedding & Knowledge Base Ingestion];
```

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Document Parsing & Page Extraction:**
    *   **Tooling:** Libraries like `PyPDF2`, `pdfminer.six`, `pypdf` (Python) or `pdf-lib` (Node.js) for initial PDF parsing.
    *   **Process:** Load PDF, extract individual pages as images (e.g., PNG, JPEG) for visual processing.
2.  **Image/Diagram/Table Detection:**
    *   **Tooling:** Computer Vision libraries (e.g., `OpenCV`, `Pillow` in Python) combined with pre-trained object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) fine-tuned for document elements, or specialized document AI tools.
    *   **Process:** Analyze each page image to identify bounding boxes for images, diagrams, and tables.
3.  **Element Extraction:**
    *   **Tooling:** Image manipulation libraries (`Pillow`) to crop identified elements.
    *   **Process:** Crop out each detected image, diagram, and table into separate image files.
4.  **OCR & Text Overlay (for Diagrams/Images):**
    *   **Tooling:** `Tesseract OCR` (with Python wrappers like `pytesseract`), Google Cloud Vision API, Azure Cognitive Services.
    *   **Process:** Apply OCR to extracted diagrams and images to extract any embedded text. This text can be associated with the image or used as an overlay for the multi-modal model.
5.  **Structured Data Conversion (for Tables):**
    *   **Tooling:** Specialized table extraction libraries (e.g., `Camelot`, `Tabula-py` for PDF tables), or multi-modal models specifically designed for table understanding.
    *   **Process:** For extracted tables, convert them into structured formats like JSON, CSV, or Markdown tables. This involves identifying rows, columns, and cell content.
6.  **Multi-Modal Model Input Preparation:**
    *   **Process:** Combine the extracted visual elements (images, diagrams) and structured table data with their associated text (from OCR or surrounding document context) into a format consumable by the chosen multi-modal LLM (e.g., base64 encoded images, JSON objects with image paths and text prompts).
7.  **Vector Embedding & Knowledge Base Ingestion:**
    *   **Process:** Generate vector embeddings for the multi-modal inputs (e.g., using the multi-modal model's embedding layer or a separate vision encoder). Ingest these embeddings, along with the original content and metadata, into ISA's vector knowledge base.

#### **3. Plan for a Small-Scale Prototype**

**Objective:** Demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of incorporating visual information into ISA's understanding and reasoning processes through a focused prototype.

**Prototype Scope:**

*   **Use Case:** Answering questions about a specific standard document that contains both text and diagrams/tables.
*   **Document Type:** A single, representative PDF document with a mix of textual content, a flowchart/diagram, and a simple data table.
*   **Focus:** Demonstrate how the multi-modal model can leverage visual information to answer questions that cannot be answered by text-only processing.

**Prototype Components:**

1.  **Document Ingestion Module:**
    *   Implement a simplified version of the proposed data preprocessing pipeline (Steps 1-5) for the chosen PDF document.
    *   Output: Separate image files for diagrams/tables, and structured text for tables.
2.  **Multi-Modal Query Module:**
    *   Integrate with a selected multi-modal LLM (e.g., Gemini Pro Vision API or a local open-source model).
    *   Input: User query (text) + relevant extracted visual elements (images/tables) from the document.
    *   Process: Formulate prompts for the multi-modal LLM that include both the textual question and the visual context.
3.  **Answer Generation & Evaluation:**
    *   Output: The multi-modal LLM's answer to the query.
    *   Evaluation: Compare answers generated with and without visual context to highlight the value of multi-modal understanding.

**Example Scenario:**

*   **Document:** A section of a GS1 standard document detailing a process flow with a diagram and a table of error codes.
*   **Question 1 (Text-only):** "What are the steps for product registration?" (Answerable from text)
*   **Question 2 (Multi-modal):** "Based on the flowchart, what is the next step after 'Data Validation'?" (Requires diagram interpretation)
*   **Question 3 (Multi-modal):** "What is the description for error code 'E001' in the error table?" (Requires table extraction and understanding)

**Success Metrics:**

*   Ability of the prototype to correctly extract and process visual elements.
*   Accuracy of multi-modal LLM in answering questions requiring visual context compared to text-only approaches.
*   Demonstration of how visual information enhances the completeness or accuracy of answers.
