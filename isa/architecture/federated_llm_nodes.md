# Federated LLM Nodes: Technical Specifications

## Objective

This document provides detailed technical specifications for federated LLM nodes, including their interaction patterns, data exchange formats, and security considerations within the ISA project.

## Overview of Federated LLM Nodes

(A high-level overview of what federated LLM nodes are, their purpose in the ISA ecosystem, and the benefits of their distributed nature will be provided here.)

## Interaction Patterns

(Details about how federated LLM nodes interact with each other and with central components of the ISA system will be specified here. This includes:
*   **Request/Response Flows:** How queries and responses are routed.
*   **Prompt Exchange:** Mechanisms for sharing and updating prompt chains.
*   **Model Updates:** How local models are updated based on federated learning.)

## Data Exchange Formats

(Details about the standardized data exchange formats used for communication between federated LLM nodes will be specified here. This includes:
*   **Prompt Formats:** Structure of prompts shared across nodes.
*   **Knowledge Exchange Formats:** How learned knowledge or model updates are serialized and transmitted.
*   **Metadata:** Any accompanying metadata for traceability and governance.)

## Security Considerations

(Comprehensive details on security measures implemented for federated LLM nodes will be specified here. This includes:
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Mechanisms for verifying node identities and controlling access.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Techniques like differential privacy or secure multi-party computation to protect sensitive data during federated learning.
*   **Trust Management:** How trust is established and maintained between nodes, potentially referencing the "Trust ledger with cross-node scoring" feature from Phase 8.)

## Scalability and Resilience

(Discussion on how the federated LLM node architecture ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience in a distributed environment will be included here.)

## Deployment and Management

(Details on the deployment strategies and management considerations for federated LLM nodes will be specified here.)
