# ELTVRE Pipeline Design

## Objective

This document details the architectural components and workflow for a robust and scalable data ingestion pipeline designed to process GS1 standards documents (especially complex PDFs) into high-quality inputs for the RAG system (vector store) and Knowledge Graph.

## ELTVRE Overview

(A high-level overview of the ELTVRE (Extract, Load, Transform, Validate, Refine, Enrich) process, its purpose, and its role in the overall ISA architecture will be provided here.)

## Architectural Components

(Details about the individual architectural components of the ELTVRE pipeline will be specified here. This may include:
*   **Extractors:** Tools and services for extracting raw data from various sources (e.g., PDF parsers, web scrapers).
*   **Loaders:** Mechanisms for loading extracted data into a staging area.
*   **Transformers:** Components for transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for the vector store and KG.
*   **Validators:** Processes for ensuring data quality and consistency.
*   **Refiners:** Steps for cleaning and normalizing data.
*   **Enrichers:** Services for adding additional context or metadata to the data.)

## Workflow and Data Flow

(A detailed workflow diagram and description of the data flow through the ELTVRE pipeline will be provided here, illustrating how data moves from raw input to processed output for the RAG system and KG.)

## Technology Stack

(Details about the specific technologies, frameworks, and libraries used for each component of the ELTVRE pipeline will be specified here.)

## Scalability, Performance, and Monitoring

(Discussion on scalability considerations, performance optimization strategies, and monitoring mechanisms for the ELTVRE pipeline will be included here.)

## Error Handling and Resilience

(Details about error handling strategies, retry mechanisms, and overall pipeline resilience will be specified here.)

## Security and Data Governance

(Details on security measures, access control, data encryption, and compliance with data governance policies for the data processed by the ELTVRE pipeline will be specified here.)
