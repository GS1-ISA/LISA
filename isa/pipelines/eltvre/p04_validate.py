"""
This module handles the 'Validate' phase of the ELTVRE pipeline.

After transformation, data quality and integrity must be explicitly
validated. This stage involves running data quality checks,
schema validation, and business rule assertions against the
transformed data. Any data that fails validation should be
quarantined for review.
