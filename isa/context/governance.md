# ISA Project Governance Document

This document outlines the governance framework for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project, ensuring consistency, quality, and strategic alignment across all development phases.

## 1. Principles of Governance

*   **Transparency:** All decisions and processes are documented and accessible.
*   **Accountability:** Clear roles and responsibilities are defined for all project activities.
*   **Consistency:** Adherence to established standards, conventions, and global instructions.
*   **Adaptability:** The governance framework is designed to evolve with project needs.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Integration of automated checks and manual reviews to maintain high standards.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Project Lead/Architect:** Oversees overall project direction, architectural integrity, and strategic alignment.
*   **Mode Owners:** Responsible for the development, maintenance, and adherence to guidelines within their specific Roo modes.
*   **Developers/Contributors:** Implement features, fix bugs, and ensure code quality and documentation.
*   **QA/Validation Team:** Ensures adherence to quality standards and validates system behavior.

## 3. Decision-Making Process

*   **Architectural Decisions:** Reviewed and approved by the Project Lead/Architect, documented in `isa/context/ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`.
*   **Roadmap Changes:** Reviewed and approved by the Project Lead, documented in `isa/context/ISA_Roadmap.md`.
*   **Feature Prioritization:** Based on roadmap, user feedback, and strategic goals.

## 4. Change Management and Versioning

*   All significant changes to code, documentation, or configuration must follow a defined review process.
*   **Mandatory Post-Edit Logging:** Every modified or added file must trigger updates to:
    *   `CHANGELOG.md`
    *   `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`
    *   `isa/versions/version_tracker.json`
    *   *Enforcement:* Automated hooks and agent logic will ensure these updates.
*   **Snapshotting:** Snapshots will be created in `isa/versions/` after major milestones (as indicated in `CHANGELOG.md`) and version bumps in `version_tracker.json`.
*   **Rollback Procedures:** In case of validation failure, the system will revert to the last file-based snapshot in `isa/versions/`. Rollback reasons will be logged in `project_journal.md`.

## 5. Documentation Standards and Completeness

*   **Centralized Glossary:** A dedicated glossary for key terms and acronyms will be maintained (e.g., `isa/context/glossary.md`).
*   **Architectural Documentation:** Detailed architectural and implementation plans for critical components (e.g., Vector Data Storage, KG Implementation, ELTVRE) will be developed and maintained in the `isa/architecture/` directory.
*   **Roadmap Accuracy:** The `isa/context/ISA_Roadmap.md` will serve as the single source of truth for all planned phases and their details.

## 6. Quality Assurance and Automation

*   **Validation Hooks:**
    *   `isa/core/isa_validator.py` will be run post-edit for consistency validation. Results will be logged in `project_journal.md`.
    *   `isa/core/isa_summarizer.py` will be invoked if more than two files are touched, summarizing system-wide changes to `status_dashboard.md`.
*   **Agent Operational Guidelines:** The agent will adhere to all global custom instructions, including context restoration, API key validation, and error escalation mechanisms (e.g., Boomerang for incomplete tasks, `isa_debugger` for uncertainty).

## 7. Security and Compliance

*   Adherence to defined security policies and best practices (e.g., secrets management, access control).
*   Compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations.
