# ISA Project Governance

This document outlines the governance principles and operational guidelines for the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project, including its mode architecture, versioning, and prompt management strategies.

## Roocode Mode Architecture (v2.1)

The Roocode Mode Architecture v2.1 introduces a refined set of specialized AI agents, each with a clear mission and optimized LLM assignment, designed to enhance the ISA project's autonomy, resilience, and intelligence.

## Mode Deprecation Logic

As defined in `isa/config/mode_versioning_strategy.md`, the deprecation process involves:
1.  **Identification:** `ARCHITECT` or `AUDITOR` identifies redundant/obsolete modes.
2.  **Integration/Migration:** Functionality is absorbed by new/enhanced modes.
3.  **Soft Deprecation:** Mode is marked `deprecated: true` and `supersededBy` in `roo_mode_map.json`. `ORCHESTRATOR` issues warnings.
4.  **Hard Deprecation/Archival:** After a grace period, mode definition and prompts are moved to `isa/config/archive/` and `isa/prompts/archive/` respectively. All UDM references are updated.

## Versioning and Prompt Design Strategies

As defined in `isa/config/mode_versioning_strategy.md`:
*   **Mode Versioning:** Implicitly tied to overall system version (`isa/versions/version_tracker.json`).
*   **Prompt Versioning:** Explicitly versioned (e.g., `roo_mode_[slug]_prompt_v[MAJOR].[MINOR].prompt.txt`) for granular tracking and rollback.
*   **Prompt A/B Testing:** `ORCHESTRATOR` (or `TRIGGER` mode) dynamically selects prompt versions, with `VALIDATOR`/`AUDITOR` analyzing outcomes.

## Branching Strategy and Pull Request Process

The ISA project adheres to a **GitHub Flow** branching strategy. All contributions must follow the guidelines outlined in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), which details:

*   **Branching:** Feature branches off `main`.
*   **Pull Requests:** Mandatory for all merges, utilizing `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
*   **Code Ownership:** Enforced via `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
*   **Branch Protection:** Critical branches (`main`) require status checks and code owner approvals.

## Tool Mappings and LLM Roles per Mode

Detailed tool mappings and LLM roles are integrated into the Mode Matrix above. Key LLM assignments are:
*   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** `ORCHESTRATOR`, `RESEARCH`, `CODER`, `VALIDATOR`, `SYNTHESIZER` (for nuanced tasks).
*   **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** `ARCHITECT` (for structured planning), `DEBUGGER`, `AUDITOR`, `BRAINSTORMER`, and new utility modes.
*   **Dynamic LLM Selection:** `ARCHITECT` can dynamically switch between Gemini and Claude based on task nature, orchestrated by `ORCHESTRATOR`.
