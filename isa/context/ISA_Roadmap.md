This initial phase focused on stabilizing the ISA deployment, productionizing core components, and implementing foundational AI features. Key actions included optimizing App Hosting configuration, hardening Firestore security rules, implementing robust secrets management, outlining CI/CD pipelines, configuring basic monitoring, refining error handling in AI flows, and reviewing `package.json` for technical debt. Core AI capabilities matured with enhanced RAG pipelines for Document Q&A (structured input, source citation, AI reasoning), implementation of an Error Detection feature, and enhancements to the `webSearch` tool and Independent Research flow. Conceptual embedding, vector search, and Knowledge Graph interaction flows/tools were prototyped. UI consistency was improved, and Zod schemas were centralized.

This includes scaling vector data storage with Vertex AI Vector Search or AlloyDB AI, implementing the GS1 Standards Knowledge Graph, and developing advanced data ingestion pipelines (ELTVRE) using Document AI, Dataflow, or Vertex AI Pipelines. Firestore optimization and enhanced MLOps foundations using Vertex AI Pipelines are also key. Advanced AI features to be implemented include real vector search, KG-RAG integration, advanced LLM reasoning (CoT, ToT), Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) exploration, causal inference (exploratory), and initial multi-modal understanding.

Architectural considerations include supporting federated learning/distributed KGs (if needed), promoting a serverless-first paradigm, enabling API Gateway for microservices, and supporting global distribution for low latency. Advanced integrations will include full multi-modal integration, proactive & personalized assistance, sophisticated self-optimization (RLAIF), predictive capabilities (concept forecasting), and deeper XAI & trust mechanisms. Future-proofing strategies emphasize modular design, API-first design, continuous learning frameworks, ethical AI practices, and strategic vendor lock-in mitigation.
