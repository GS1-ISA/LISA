# ISA Data Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the official data strategy for the ISA project. It establishes the policies and procedures for data handling, from acquisition and cleaning to annotation, quality assurance, and security. Adherence to this strategy is mandatory for all project contributors to ensure data integrity, consistency, and compliance. This strategy is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.

## 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation

All data ingested into the ISA project must undergo a standardized cleaning and transformation process to ensure it is fit for purpose.

### Rules:
- **Normalization:** All text data will be normalized to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase, UTF-8 encoding).
- **Whitespace Handling:** Redundant whitespace (leading, trailing, multiple spaces) will be removed.
- **Special Character Removal:** Non-essential special characters will be removed or replaced, unless they carry semantic meaning relevant to the task (e.g., code snippets).
- **Standardization:** Numerical data will be standardized to a common scale or format where applicable.
- **ETL Logging:** All transformations applied to a dataset must be logged and versioned, ensuring reproducibility.

## 3. Data Annotation Standards

High-quality annotations are critical for training and evaluating our models. The following standards apply to all annotation tasks.

### Procedures:
- **Annotation Guidelines:** Every annotation task must have a clear, detailed guideline document. This document will define all labels, provide positive and negative examples, and clarify edge cases.
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA):** For each task, a subset of the data will be annotated by multiple annotators to calculate IAA (e.g., using Cohen's Kappa). A minimum IAA score of 0.8 is required before proceeding with full-scale annotation.
- **Annotation Tools:** Only approved annotation tools may be used. All tools must support versioning of annotations.
- **Review Process:** All annotations must undergo a peer-review process. A senior annotator or data scientist will have the final sign-off.

## 4. Data Quality Assurance (QA)

Automated and manual QA checks are integral to our data pipeline.

### QA Metrics:
- **Completeness:** Percentage of records with no missing values for critical fields.
- **Validity:** Data conforms to a defined schema (e.g., correct data types, ranges, and formats).
- **Uniqueness:** No duplicate records exist where they are not expected.
- **Consistency:** Data is consistent across different datasets and over time.

### Automated Validation Steps:
- **Schema Validation:** All incoming data will be validated against a predefined JSON schema.
- **Integrity Checks:** Automated scripts will run to check for duplicates, outliers, and other anomalies.
- **Validation Reports:** A validation report will be generated for every new batch of data. Data that fails validation will be quarantined for manual review.

## 5. PII and Sensitive Data Handling

The ISA project is committed to the highest standards of data privacy and security.

### Policies:
- **Data Minimization:** We will only collect and retain the minimum amount of data necessary for a given task.
- **PII Detection:** Automated tools will be used to scan all incoming data for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses.
- **Anonymization:** All detected PII must be anonymized before the data is used for any purpose. Approved techniques include:
    - **Redaction:** Completely removing the PII.
    - **Pseudonymization:** Replacing PII with a consistent, randomly generated identifier.
    - **Generalization:** Replacing specific information with a more general category (e.g., replacing a specific age with an age range).
- **Access Control:** Access to raw, non-anonymized data is strictly limited to authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis. All access must be logged and audited.
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data will be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
