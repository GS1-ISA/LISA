# ISA Roo Definitive Architecture v1.0

This document outlines the definitive architecture of the Intelligent Standards Assistant (ISA) project, focusing on its modular design, inter-component relationships, and data flows.

## 1. Core Architectural Principles

*   **Modularity:** Components are designed to be loosely coupled and highly cohesive, facilitating independent development, testing, and deployment.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture supports horizontal scaling to handle increasing data volumes and user loads.
*   **Extensibility:** New features and integrations can be added with minimal impact on existing components.
*   **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing are integrated to provide insights into system health and performance.
*   **Security:** Security is a fundamental consideration, with robust authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms.
*   **Traceability:** All changes and operations are logged and versioned for auditability and rollback capabilities.

## 2. High-Level System Overview

The ISA system is composed of several key modules that interact to provide intelligent assistance for GS1 standards.
