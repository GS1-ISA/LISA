These files provide detailed insights into the objectives, key goals, systems involved, and milestones for various development phases, particularly Phase 11, 12, 13, and 14.

### 2. Revised List of Core Documentation Files and Their Actual Paths

Based on the project scan and content analysis, here's a revised list of core documentation files and their actual or inferred paths. I've also noted files that are critical per custom instructions but are currently missing or have moved.

**Identified Core Documentation Files (and their new/inferred paths):**

*   **Strategic Roadmap/Blueprint:** [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md)
    *   *Note:* This document explicitly states it serves as the "central blueprint, strategic roadmap, and evolving development log." It contains a "Summary Roadmap Table" and detailed phase descriptions, effectively replacing the previous `roadmap.md` and `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`.
*   **Folder-to-Phase Mapping:** [`docs/folder_phase_map.md`](docs/folder_phase_map.md)
    *   *Note:* Provides a mapping of repository folders to relevant ISA development phases.
*   **Phase-specific Documentation:** (See list above for all identified "phase" files)
    *   *Note:* These files detail the objectives, concepts, and mission prompts for various future phases (e.g., Phase 11, 12, 13).
*   **Mode Configuration:** [`isa/config/roo_mode_map.json`](isa/config/roo_mode_map.json)
    *   *Note:* This file exists and likely contains configuration for Roo modes.
*   **Version Tracking:** [`ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml`](ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml)
    *   *Note:* This file tracks `isa_version` and `phases_tracked`. It appears to be the current version tracker, potentially replacing `version_tracker.json`.
*   **Governance Strategy:** [`ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated 2/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md`](ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated%202/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md)
    *   *Note:* This document outlines expanded mitigation strategies related to governance, likely serving as the primary governance documentation.
*   **Technical Report (IAM Strategy):** [`docs/technical_report.md`](docs/technical_report.md)
    *   *Note:* This document provides a comprehensive IAM enhancement strategy, which is a critical infrastructure component.

**Critical Files Mentioned in Custom Instructions (Missing or Path Discrepancy):**

The following files are explicitly mentioned in the custom instructions for context restoration or mandatory logging, but were not found at their expected paths or have content in other locations:

*   `isa/context/roadmap.md`: Content is now in [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md).
*   `isa/roo_modes.md`: No direct documentation file for modes was found. Only `isa/config/roo_mode_map.json` exists for configuration.
*   `isa_manifest.yaml`: This critical file was not found.
*   `CHANGELOG.md`: This critical file was not found.
*   `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`: This critical file was not found.
*   `isa/versions/version_tracker.json`: Content appears to be in [`ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml`](ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml), but the custom instructions still refer to this specific path for logging.
*   `isa/context/governance.md`: Content is now in [`ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated 2/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md`](ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated%202/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md).
*   `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md`: Content is now in [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md).

### 3. Detailed Comprehensive Review Plan

This plan outlines a strategy to assess consistency, completeness, and identify areas for improvement or new tasks within the current project structure.

#### Phase 1: Initial Project Orientation & Documentation Alignment

**Objective:** Establish a clear understanding of the current project structure and align the system's operational expectations with the actual documentation paths.

1.  **Review Foundational Documents:**
    *   Thoroughly read [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md) to grasp the overall strategic roadmap, architectural foundation, and development log. Pay close attention to the "Summary Roadmap Table" and the detailed descriptions of Phase 1 (Completed) and Phase 2 (Active).
    *   Examine [`docs/folder_phase_map.md`](docs/folder_phase_map.md) to understand how the physical directory structure maps to the conceptual development phases.
2.  **Understand Development Phases (10-18):**
    *   Review all identified "phase" files (e.g., `phase11_mission_prompt.md`, `phase12_concept.md`, `phase11.md`, `phase12.md`, `phase13.md`) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the objectives, innovations, systems, and milestones for current and future development.
3.  **Address Documentation Path Discrepancies:**
    *   **Action:** Propose updating the global custom instructions to reflect the new paths for `roadmap.md` (now [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md)), `governance.md` (now [`ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated 2/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md`](ISA_Future_Phases_Full_Updated%202/ISA_Governance_Strategy.md)), and `ISA_Roo_Definitive_Architecture_v1.md` (now also largely covered by [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md)).
    *   **Action:** For `isa_manifest.yaml`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `isa/logs/agent_task_history.json`, if they are truly missing, create empty placeholder files at their expected root/isa/logs/isa/versions paths. This is crucial to ensure the system's mandatory logging and context restoration mechanisms can function without errors.
    *   **Action:** Clarify the status of `isa/versions/version_tracker.json` versus [`ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml`](ISA_Full_System_Export/VERSION.yaml). If `VERSION.yaml` is the intended replacement, the custom instructions should be updated. If `version_tracker.json` is still expected for logging, a placeholder might be needed.
    *   **Action:** Investigate if there's a new location or equivalent for `isa/roo_modes.md` that provides documentation on modes, beyond just the configuration in `isa/config/roo_mode_map.json`. If not, note this as a documentation gap.

#### Phase 2: Deep Dive into Current Development Phases

**Objective:** Gain a detailed understanding of the active and immediately upcoming development phases, assessing their internal consistency and alignment with the overall roadmap.

1.  **Focus on Active/Upcoming Phases:**
    *   Prioritize a deep dive into Phase 11 (Distributed Standards Evolution) and Phase 12 (Standards Market Simulation & Predictive Governance), as these appear to be the most detailed and active future phases.
    *   Review all related documents for these phases (e.g., `phase11_mission_prompt.md`, `phase11.md`, `phase12_concept.md`, `phase12.md`).
2.  **Assess Internal Consistency:**
    *   Verify that the mission prompts, concept documents, and detailed phase descriptions for Phase 11 and 12 are consistent in their objectives, key goals, and expected outcomes.
    *   Identify any discrepancies or ambiguities within these phase documents.
3.  **Review Infrastructure Documentation:**
    *   Examine [`docs/technical_report.md`](docs/technical_report.md) to understand the IAM enhancement strategy, as robust infrastructure is critical for supporting advanced AI phases.
    *   Cross-reference the infrastructure plans in `docs/blueprint.md` (e.g., for Vector Data Storage, KG Implementation, ELTVRE) with the technical report and phase documents.

#### Phase 3: Cross-cutting Consistency & Completeness Check

**Objective:** Evaluate the overall coherence of the project documentation and identify any significant gaps or areas requiring further definition.

1.  **Global Consistency Check:**
    *   **Roadmap Alignment:** Ensure that the "Summary Roadmap Table" in [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md) accurately reflects the details provided in individual phase documents and the `folder_phase_map.md`.
    *   **Architectural Coherence:** Verify that the architectural components described in [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md) are consistently referenced and supported by the plans in the phase documents (e.g., how KG integration in Phase 2 aligns with the overall KG implementation strategy).
2.  **Documentation Completeness Assessment:**
    *   Identify any missing documentation for critical components or processes, especially for Phase 2 (e.g., detailed plans for real vector store integration, specific KG schema design, ELTVRE implementation details beyond the high-level overview).
    *   Are there clear definitions for all key terms and acronyms used across documents?
3.  **Dependency Mapping (Mermaid Diagram):**
    *   Create a visual representation of the dependencies between different development phases and key architectural components. This will highlight critical paths and potential bottlenecks.

4.  **Tooling & Process Alignment:**
    *   Review how the current project structure and documentation align with the global custom instructions (e.g., logging requirements, validation hooks, snapshotting procedures). Identify any areas where the current setup deviates from these instructions.

#### Phase 4: Identifying Areas for Improvement & New Tasks

**Objective:** Propose actionable recommendations for documentation enhancement and new development tasks based on the comprehensive review.

1.  **Documentation Improvements:**
    *   Suggest specific updates or additions to existing documents to improve clarity, consistency, and completeness.
    *   Recommend creating new documentation if significant gaps are identified (e.g., a dedicated `roo_modes.md` if no equivalent is found).
2.  **Custom Instruction Updates:**
    *   Formally propose changes to the global custom instructions to reflect the actual paths of core documentation files, ensuring future operations are aligned.
3.  **New Development Tasks:**
    *   Based on identified gaps or inconsistencies, propose new tasks for the Code or Architect modes (e.g., "Implement missing `isa_manifest.yaml`," "Refactor phase documentation for better discoverability," "Develop a tool to validate documentation consistency").
4.  **Centralized Documentation Strategy:**
    *   Recommend consolidating core documentation files into a more centralized and consistent location (e.g., within `isa/context/` or `docs/`) to simplify future context restoration and adherence to custom instructions.
