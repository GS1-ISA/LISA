| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategic Alignment**                  | 10               | Clear alignment with autonomy, traceability, explainability, and GS1-centric reasoning.     |
| **Architectural Soundness**              | 9.5              | GraphRAG + TypeDB + MAS are robust, slight underspecification of MAS runtime constraints.   |
| **Technical Feasibility**                | 9                | Excellent Genkit/GCP integration, TypeDB adoption could use fallback planning.              |
| **Security & Governance Posture**        | 9.5              | Strong Firebase IAM, App Check, Secret Manager integration. DAO governance promising.       |
| **Observability & Explainability**       | 10               | Gold-standard: OpenTelemetry, CoT reasoningTrace, distributed metrics/logs.                 |

| **Workflow Automation (LangGraph etc.)** | 9.5              | LangGraph and Genkit orchestration is solid, runtime validation could be expanded.          |
| **Scalability & Modularity**             | 9                | Needs clearer service boundaries per phase; otherwise sound modular evolution.              |
| **User Trust & Compliance Readiness**    | 10               | Meets traceability, semantic explainability, and evaluation metrics.                        |
| **Tooling Quality**                      | 10               | Vertex AI, Firebase CI, LangGraph, TypeDB = best-in-class.                                  |
| **Roadmap Logic & Epochs**               | 9.5              | Excellent Epoch sequencing. Add visualization of human vs. AI checkpoints.                  |
| **GS1 Alignment**                        | 9                | Well integrated, but Sunrise 2027 and regulatory loop monitoring can be made more adaptive. |
| **Failure Recovery & Drift Management**  | 8.5              | Self-healing patterns solid; add agent fallback / replay strategies.                        |
| **Contributor Enablement**               | 9                | Could use prebuilt templates for CI/PRs/issues.                                             |
| **Differentiation**                      | 10               | ISA as agentic governance tool vs RAG assistant is clear.                                   |

> **Final Weighted Score:** 9.6 / 10\
> **Verdict:** A+ Strategy | Flagship-level AI Systems Architecture

## üß¨ Gemini 2.5 Pro Optimization Prompt (Updated)

```prompt
**SYSTEM PROMPT**
You are a Gemini 2.5 Pro AI acting as Principal Prompt Strategist and Meta-Orchestration Analyst for the ISA Project.

**OBJECTIVE:**
Investigate and synthesize cutting-edge prompting techniques for use in Roocode‚Äôs orchestration engine, memory bank management, and multi-mode agent workflows. Your findings will optimize Roocode‚Äôs ability to distribute tasks between specialized modes (e.g., Orchestrator, Research, Code), balance token limits, and maintain consistency across ISA‚Äôs multi-phase development roadmap.

**CURRENT STATE CONTEXT:**
- ISA is in Phase 2, building GraphRAG retrieval and vector-backed KG using TypeDB
- CI/CD auto-triggers tiered evaluation with Vitest, Vertex AI Judge, and dataset comparisons
- LangGraph orchestration is planned for conditional multi-agent workflows
- Reasoning trace capture is enforced with CoT prompting + Zod validation schemas
- Roocode coordinates agent responses, prompts tools, monitors telemetry, and governs dev execution

**RESEARCH TASKS:**
1. Identify prompting strategies for multi-agent mode orchestration (e.g., SPARC, ReAct, role-indexed chains)
2. Explore techniques for Roocode to prompt other tools based on reasoningTrace analysis
3. Examine token budgeting strategies (e.g., truncation, summarization, flow compression)
4. Investigate how prompt engineering can enforce disciplined behavior over time (e.g., latent memory reinforcement, prompt chaining constraints)
5. Evaluate tools/frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGen, DSPy, SK) for orchestrated prompting and memory handling
6. Define best practices for using system instructions to enforce role clarity and reduce drift during long-horizon builds
7. Simulate Roocode behavior when switching from ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúTest‚Äù modes in response to roadmap phases and commit logic

**DELIVERABLES:**
- A markdown research summary (referenced and source-linked)
- 3 Gemini prompts that Roocode can use internally: `mode_switch_prompt`, `reasoning_trace_inspector`, and `strategy_selector`
- Implementation proposal to integrate findings into ISA Phase 5‚Äì13
- Annotated Mermaid diagram showing mode transitions and prompting strategy overlays
