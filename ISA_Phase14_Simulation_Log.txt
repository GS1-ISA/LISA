================ ISA Phase 14 Simulation Log ================

Phase: Phase 14 - Cross-Standard Schema Alignment
Start Trigger: ✅ Initiated by roadmap milestone and Phase 13 handoff

🧩 Objectives:
- Align schema concepts across healthcare, retail, logistics GS1 standards
- Translate structural/semantic conflicts using AI agents
- Harmonize differences via automated LangGraph node flows

👥 Agents Involved:
- SchemaDiffAgent (identifies cross-standard variances)
- TranslatorAgent (auto-generates conceptual mappings and proposals)
- GovernanceAgent (resolves conflicts and votes)
- ValidatorAgent (tests and logs proposal impact)

📘 Key Artifacts:
- /ISA_Future_Phases/phase14/planning_prompt.md
- /ISA_KnowledgeGraph/schema_diff_report.json
- /ISA_Governance/voting_log_phase14.yaml
- /docs/standard_alignment_summary.md

📊 Cycle:
1. SchemaDiffAgent flags a critical mismatch in “batch vs. lot” usage across standards
2. TranslatorAgent proposes dual-definition mapping
3. GovernanceAgent simulates LLM vote: 2/3 favor hybrid alias strategy
4. ValidatorAgent confirms model output consistency
5. Changes committed to /ontology/GS1-alignment.ttl
6. Diff log updated, version drift noted in VERSION.yaml

🔁 Feedback Loop:
- Phase 15 notified of semantic drift checkpoint
- Phase 12’s living ontology contract adjusted for dual-terminology tracking
- Gemini prompt adjusted to track new schema relations

✅ Result: Cross-standard harmony patch successfully integrated
